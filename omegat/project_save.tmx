        <seg>Jogging ahead a bit further, Chen Pingan passed by a stone archway. Due to the fact that the archway was supported by 12 stone pillars, the local residents liked to refer to it as the crab archway. As for what the archway's actual name was, Song Jixin and Liu Yangxian had very different accounts. Song Jixin swore that he had read on an old book by the name of "Local County Chronicles" that the archway was called the Grand Secretary Archway, and that it had been bestowed upon the town by the emperor at the time to commemorate a official in history who had made significant contributions in overseeing military forces. In contrast, Liu Xianyang was just as much of a hillbilly as Chen Pingan, and he insisted that this place was known as the Crab Archway. It had been referred to as such for several centuries, and in his eyes, there was no reason to give it a nonsensical name like the Grand Secretary Arch. In addition to that, Liu Xianyang had also posed a question to Song Jixin: "How big is the official hat of a grand secretary? Is it bigger than the opening of the Iron Lock Well?"

Song Jixin had no answer to this, and he was left flushing furiously with embarrassment.</seg>

        <seg>After passing through another street, Chen Pingan heard the familiar sound of reading ringing out nearby. There was a private school there, and it was jointly funded by several of the most affluent families in the town. The teacher was from out of town, and back in his younger days, Chen Pingan would often squat down outside the window and listen to the lesson being taught in secret. The teaching was very strict during classes, but he never called out or got in the way of freeloaders like Chen Pingan. After that, Chen Pingan traveled out of the town to become a disciple at a dragon kiln, and he hadn't visited the school since then.</seg>

        <seg>The young boy's name was Chen Pingan, and both his parents had passed away at a very early stage in his life. The town that he lived in was extremely renowned for producing chinaware. Ever since the founding of the nation, the town had taken on the important task of producing chinaware to be offered to the imperial court, and there were imperial officials constantly stationed in the town, overseeing the operation of the official kilns. Without any parents to rely on, Chen Pingan became a potter at a very young age. In the beginning, he was only able to perform some menial tasks and manual labor, toiling away arduously for several years under a reluctant master with a terrible temper. In a cruel twist of fate, just when he had begun to grasp some of the basics of pottery firing, the town suddenly lost the right to host official kilns. Over the course of just a single night, all of the dozens of coiling-dragon-like kilns throughout the town were ordered to be shut down by the authorities.</seg>
