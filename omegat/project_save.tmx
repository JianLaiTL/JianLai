        <seg>Coincidentally, almost all of the 10 letters that Chen Ping'an had been tasked with delivering were addressed to the renowned affluent families in the town. However, this was quite a reasonable occurrence. As the saying went, the offspring of dragons and phoenixes were destined to soar in the heavens, while the offspring of mice could burrow in the dirt. Those who were traveling far away and able to send letters back to their families had to have come from privileged backgrounds. Otherwise, they wouldn't have had the courage and financial backing to go to such faraway places. For nine of the 10 letters, Chen Ping'an only had to go to two places, namely Fortune Deer Street and Peach Leaf Alley. The bluestone slabs that paved these streets were as large as bedsteads, and he felt rather uneasy as he stepped onto them for the first time. He unconsciously slowed down in his footsteps, and he was struck by a sense of inferiority, feeling as if he were soiling the ground with his straw sandals.</seg>

        <seg>He didn't envy Liu Xianyang for his remarkable aptitude, strength, and charisma. Instead, he envied Liu Xianyang's fearlessness. No matter where he went, Liu Xianyang was never fazed by anything, nor did he ever feel like living alone was a bad thing. Wherever he went, he was always able to quickly make friends with whoever he met, getting on such friendly terms with them that they referred to one another as brothers and would drink and play drinking games together. Due to his grandfather's ill health, Liu Xianyang was forced to become self-dependent from a very young age, making him a leader of sorts among the children in the area. He was skilled at everything, whether it be catching snakes, fishing, procuring eggs from bird's nests, making bows, fishing rods, slingshots, bird cages... It seemed like there was nothing that he couldn't do. In particular, he was the undisputed king of the town when it came to catching catfish and fishing for eels in the channels of water running through plots of farmland. Back when Liu Xianyang dropped out of the private school, the teacher there, Mr. Xu, had paid a visit to Liu Xianyang's grandfather on his sickbed, offering to Liu Xianyang an education free of charge. However, Liu Xianyang refused to go back no matter what, telling the teacher that all he wanted to do was earn money, and that he had no interest in an education. Mr. Xu then offered Liu Xianyang a paid job as a scholar's attendant, but Liu Xianyang turned down that offer as well. As it turned out, Liu Xianyang was doing quite well for himself. Even though Old Man Yao had passed away and the dragon kilns had been shut down, it didn't take long before he caught the eye of the blacksmith from Dragon Rider Alley, and he was currently busy building his own forge in the southern part of the town.</seg>

The child was an orphan, and he was very stubborn, refusing to cry no matter how much he was bullied, something that only served to further infuriate Liu Xianyang. One year, Liu Xianyang could tell that the little orphan most likely wasn't going to be able to make it through the winter, and he was finally stung by his conscience. Having already become a disciple of Old Man Yao's at the time, he took the young boy to the dragon kiln that was situated beside Treasure Creek.

Even as his best disciple, Liu Xianyang wasn't spared from his beatings and insults, but even a blind man could sense the good intentions behind Old Man Yao's words and actions. For example, there was one time when he went a little too far, inflicting a bleeding gash onto Liu Xianyang's forehead. As a tough young boy, Liu Xianyang didn't think much of this, but Old Man Yao was feeling very remorseful over his actions. However, he had always kept up a stern and authoritative facade in front of his disciples, so he couldn't bring himself to apologize or enquire about his condition. In the end, he paced back and forht in his own room for almost an entire night, and he was still concerned about Liu Xianyang.

        <seg>Jogging ahead a bit further, Chen Ping'an passed by a stone archway. Due to the fact that the archway was supported by 12 stone pillars, the local residents liked to refer to it as the crab archway. As for what the archway's actual name was, Song Jixin and Liu Yangxian had very different accounts. Song Jixin swore that he had read on an old book by the name of "Local County Chronicles" that the archway was called the Grand Secretary Archway, and that it had been bestowed upon the town by the emperor at the time to commemorate a official in history who had made significant contributions in overseeing military forces. In contrast, Liu Xianyang was just as much of a hillbilly as Chen Ping'an, and he insisted that this place was known as the Crab Archway. It had been referred to as such for several centuries, and in his eyes, there was no reason to give it a nonsensical name like the Grand Secretary Arch. In addition to that, Liu Xianyang had also posed a question to Song Jixin: "How big is the official hat of a grand secretary? Is it bigger than the opening of the Iron Lock Well?"

Song Jixin had no answer to this, and he was left flushing furiously with embarrassment.</seg>

His thin blanket didn't do a very good job of keeping him warm, and he had developed the habit of waking up early and going to bed late back when he was learning to become a potter. He opened the door before stepping out onto the soft and loamy soil in the courtyard outside, then took a deep breath. After stretching out his body, he made his way out of the courtyard and turned to discover a thin and frail figure. It was none other than Song Jixin's maidservant, and she huddled over, trying to open the gate of the neighboring courtyard with her shoulder while carrying a bucket of water with both hands. It seemed that she had just drawn some water from the Iron Lock Well in Apricot Blossom Valley.</seg>

Song Jixin often said some things that were very difficult to understand. He most likely took those esoteric sayings from the books that he read, and Chen Ping'an was often left scratching his head in befuddlement. For example, a few days ago, Song Jixin had been saying something something along the lines of "beware of the spring chill, for it has been the death of many a young man", and Chen Ping'an had no idea what that meant. However, he had first-hand experience of the strange phenomenon where the initial period of spring felt colder than the winter each year. Song Jixin referred to this phenomenon as the unexpected spring chill, which caught many people off guard before claiming their lives, much like a sudden and unforeseen retaliation from an opponent on the battlefield.</seg>
