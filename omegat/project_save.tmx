The child was still very young, with two lines of snot trailing out of his nostrils, but he could tell a very coherent and organized story, completely unlike the average rural child who had only been attending school for half a year. At this moment, the child was looking up with a pair of large eyes that resembled black grapes, and with a gentle sniffle, the two lines of snot retreated back into his nostrils. The child was looking at the storyteller who was carrying the large white bowl, and he said, "That's the end of my story. You're going to show me what's in your bowl now, right?"</seg>

No matter where he went, Liu Xianyang was never fazed by anything, nor did he ever feel like living alone was a bad thing. Wherever he went, he was always able to quickly make friends with whoever he met, getting on such friendly terms with them that they referred to one another as brothers and would drink and play drinking games together. Due to his grandfather's ill health, Liu Xianyang was forced to become self-dependent from a very young age, making him a leader of sorts among the children in the area. He was skilled at everything, whether it be catching snakes, fishing, procuring eggs from bird's nests, making bows, fishing rods, slingshots, bird cages... It seemed like there was nothing that he couldn't do. In particular, he was the undisputed king of the town when it came to catching catfish and fishing for eels in the channels of water running through plots of farmland. Back when Liu Xianyang dropped out of the private school, the teacher there, Mr. Xu, had paid a visit to Liu Xianyang's grandfather on his sickbed, offering to Liu Xianyang an education free of charge. However, Liu Xianyang refused to go back no matter what, telling the teacher that all he wanted to do was earn money, and that he had no interest in an education. Mr. Xu then offered Liu Xianyang a paid job as a scholarly attendant, but Liu Xianyang turned down that offer as well. As it turned out, Liu Xianyang was doing quite well for himself. Even though Old Man Yao had passed away and the dragon kilns had been shut down, it didn't take long before he caught the eye of the blacksmith from Dragon Rider Alley, and he was currently busy building his own forge in the southern part of the town.</seg>

Hence, he had developed the habit of performing this type of practice whenever there was something on his mind. The crat of pottery firing was one that depended greatly on the will of the heavens. Prior to uncovering a piece of chinaware, no one knew whether its form, coloration, and glaze would be up to standard, and one could only take what they were given by the gods. However, prior to firing a piece of pottery, the molding process was undoubtedly extremely important.

At that point, the man was already completely exhausted, and he left the pile of chain next to the well winch, proclaiming that he was going to be back the next day, and that he was determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. However, on the very same day after he returned home, he died on his bed, bleeding out of all of his orifices, and he refused to close his eyes in death. No matter what his family members tried, they were unable to get his corpse to close its eyes. In the end, an old man whose family had lived near the well for generations instructed that family to carry the corpse over to the well so that it could "watch" the old man return the chain back into the well. Finally, after the entire chain had sunk down into the depths, the body finally closed its eyes.</seg>

The child was an orphan, and he was very stubborn, refusing to cry no matter how much he was bullied, something that only served to further infuriate Liu Xianyang. One year, Liu Xianyang could tell that the little orphan most likely wasn't going to be able to make it through the winter, and he was finally stung by his conscience. Having already become a disciple of Old Man Yao's at the time, he took the young boy to the dragon kiln that was situated beside Treasure Creek. They headed west out of the town, traveling over dozens of kilometers of rugged mountain terrain under heavy snowfall. To this day, Liu Xianyang still couldn't understand how the emaciated young boy with a pair of legs as thin as baby bamboo shoots had managed to walk all the way to the dragon kiln. Even though Old Man Yao ultimately took in Chen Ping'an, the disparity in his treatment of the two boys was night and day. Even as his best disciple, Liu Xianyang wasn't spared from his beatings and insults, but even a blind man could sense the good intentions behind Old Man Yao's words and actions. For example, there was one time when he went a little too far, inflicting a bleeding gash onto Liu Xianyang's forehead. As a tough young boy, Liu Xianyang didn't think much of this, but Old Man Yao was feeling very remorseful over his actions. However, he had always kept up a stern and authoritative facade in front of his disciples, so he couldn't bring himself to apologize or enquire about his condition. In the end, he paced back and forht in his own room for almost an entire night, and he was still concerned about Liu Xianyang. Finally, he had no choice but to call over Chen Ping'an to deliver a bottle of ointment to Liu Xianyang.</seg>

Of course, in addition to that, all of his neighbors on Clay Vase Alley were also a little wary of his birth date, regardless of whether they were willing to admit it or not. According to the superstitions in the town, the fifth day of the fifth month was considered to be an ominous day during which the five poisons, namely centipedes, snakes, scorpions, geckos, and toads, all came out to spread disease and misfortune. That, in addition to the fact that his parents had passed away while he was still at a very young age, inevitably made it so that there was a negative stigma surrounding him. In particular, the old people who liked to gather under the old locust tree would always intentionally distance themselves from Chen Ping'an and encourage their grandchildren and great grandchildren to do the same. However, whenever those children asked why they should stay away from Chen Ping'an, those old people would be unable to give an explanation.</seg>

        <seg>According to the earliest rules set by the four sages, outsiders who engaged in battle in the town were to be punished. The punish wasn't very severe, but it wasn't just going to be a light punishment, either. If an outsider were to kill any of the mortal residents of the town, they would be evicted without exception, but there were loopholes to be exploited when it came to battles between outsiders, and for three of the groups of outsiders who had entered the town, including Gao Zhen's, they had all brought "servants" with them precisely because they knew that there was a chance that this rule could be broken. In the case that the rule was broken, they would be able to use their servants as scapegoats and place the blamd squarely on them. It had cost half of the wealth saved up in the imperial vault of the Great Sui Nation's emperor just to earn entry for a single person into the town. The imperial vault contained what was essentially the emperor's private stash, so half of the wealth in the entire vault was naturally an exorbitant amount. If it weren't for the possibility that battles could break out between the factions of outsiders entering the town, there was no way that Wu Yue would've been sent in alongside Gao Zhen.</seg>

Song Jixin was rather reluctant, but the person who extended the invitation told him that he was there on Mr. Qi's behalf, and that Mr. Qi wanted to see if he had made any improvement in his play. Song Jixin harbored a mixture of indescribable emotions toward the serious and authoritative Mr. Qi. It was a combination of respect and fear. Hence, he had no choice but to accept the invitation, given that it was from Mr. Qi. However, he insisted on staying to hear the end of the story before going to the private school. Thus, the azure-robed young boy who had acted as Mr. Qi's messenger could only return first. Prior to his departure, he urged Song Jixin not to be too late, nagging him with the same old spiel about how Mr. Qi was a man of rules and principles, and that he didn't like it when people were tardy and lacking in punctuality.</seg>

To start off the stone guessing minigame, Song Jixin would pull out a handful of white stones of indeterminate number from the box. The azure-robed young boy would then pull out either one or two black stones, and if he could guess whether the number of white stones in Song Jixin's hand was odd or even, then he would receive the black stones and go first, thereby giving him an advantage.

As for the weathy clans, they were too far above a poor hillbilly like him. In fact, Chen Ping'an hadn't even set foot on any of the wide and spacious alleys where some of the wealthy clans resided in clusters. Those streets were mostly paved with large bluestone slabs so there was no risk of having to slosh through mud even on rainy days. After centuries of being trodden on by people, horses, and carriages, the high-quality bluestone slabs had already been polished to the point that they were as smooth as mirrors.</seg>

Back when Old Man Yao was around, there was one time when he had a little too much to drink, and he told his disciples, including Chen Ping'an and Liu Xianyang, that they were the only ones under the heavens manning official kilns, that the chinaware that they produced was imperial ware used by the emperor and the empress, that no matter how rich or lofty in official status someone was, they would be beheaded if they dared to use imperial ware themselves.

Hence, the kiln supervision official sent by the imperial court naturally became the most prominent figure in the town, much like the all-powerful decision makers seen in stageplays. Out of the dozens of kiln supervision officials that had been assigned to the town throughout history, Master Song was the most popular with the people. He wasn't like the high and mighty officials that came before him. He didn't hide away in his official manor to work on personal cultivation, nor did he turn away all visitors and focus solely on reading and self-education. Instead, he always attended to matters related to the creation of imperial ware in person, and he was even more like a commoner than the potters working at the kilns. During the dozen or so years in which he was at the town, his original scholarly appearance had been replaced by a dark tan, and his regular attire was no different from what was worn by the men working in the fields. He never put on a high and mighty front when dealing with others, but unfortunately, the imperial ware fired using the dragon kilns in the town were never quite up to standard, regardless of whether it was in terms of shape and form, or their coloration and glaze. In fact, the imperial ware that was produced had regressed compared with before, much to the puzzlement of the old kiln masters. </seg>

Given the slower acting nature of the medicine, it'll take a little longer for Ning Yao to make a full recovery, so more medicinal ingredients will have to be purchased than otherwise, but that's just a matter of money. I've written down when the medicines needs to be brought up to a boil over a high flame, and when it needs to be brought down to a simmer over a low flame, as well as when the medicine needs to be brewed and consumed.

        <seg>The Daoist priest stood beside his cart, joining his index and middle fingers before extending them together and gently stroking the white scabbard of Ning Yao's flying sword, and the sword flew stealthily into the room. It appeared that Ning Yao didn't want to startle Chen Ping'an, so she didn't kick up a fuss and silently accepted the presence of the flying sword. The Daoist priest fell into deep thought for a moment, habitually tapping the lotus flower hat on his head as he did so. After taking some time to arrange his words, he said, "Prior to coming here, I heard from my senior disciple brother that we have to be reasonable in the way that we do things, and that it's important to cater to the feelings of others. Hence, I can't be too harsh and dogmatic with my words here. While it's true that everyone has their own fate, the fundamental doctrine of the sect that I belong to is different from the doctrines of more orthodox sects. Every meeting has some element of karma attached to it, and I would say that there has been some good karma established between the two of us. Hence, I'm inclined to bestow a gift upon you before I leave. I can't give you that bamboo tube and the 108 slips as the causality would be too chaotic, and they would be more trouble than they're woth in your hands. As ofr my private seal, that's a bit too hefty a gift to give. If the formation is removed, the entire town would be completely exposed, and I would be doing you a massive disserice rathre than helping you. Will I have to resrot to giving you money as a parting gift? That would be way too vulgar and tacky, I simply wouldn't be able to live with myself..."</seg>

One of those pouches contained the toll that had to be given to the gatekeeper in order to be granted access into the town. Regardless of the status of the gatekeeper, regardless of the condition of the town gate, even the ruler of a nation or the founder of a sect had to follow this rule upon coming here. The other two embroidered pouches signified that each of them was only permitted to take a maximum of two treasures to be taken out of the town. Outside of the maximum allotted quota of two treasure, regardless of whether one managed to collect 10 treasures, or even 100, every single one of them had to be returned. The tokens in the pouches consisted of three special types of copper coins, one of which was used by the common folk to celebrate beam raising ceremonies, another was hung upwith the peach talismans in the imperial palace each year to welcome the arrival of spring, and the final type of coin was offered up to be placed on the palms of city god statues. These three types of coins were all referred to as copper coins, but in reality, they had been minted using gold essence, which was an extremely precious material. For teh majority of the town's residents, even official silver was a very rare sight, let alone hefty bags of gold, so it was no wonder that these people were willing to sell their clans' prized treasures, some of which had already been passed down for gernerations.</seg>

        <seg>In the Clay Vase Alley, Song Jixin was currently flipping through a thick and ancient Local County Chronicle. He was able to discover many patterns, such as how this book was approximately appended to and edited once every 60 years. Thus, Song Jixin privately referred to this book as the "Sixty-Year Chronicle". Something else he noticed was that those who were brought out of the small town by distant relatives at a young age would almost never return. It was as if they didn't like returning to their hometown — they were like flowers that bloomed inside the town, yet whose fragrance could only be enjoyed outside. Indeed, it was in this manner that many clans and families took root and grew in the outside world. In fact, some of them even grew into towering trees with deep and strudy roots. Thus, Song Jixin also nicknamed this book "Beyond the Wall".</seg>

He then explained, "I have only come here as I'm in a very troublesome predicament and had no choice but to journey to this place. I'm not in any direct danger for now, but the longer I stay here, the more... Just as that boy, Song Jixin, said, too much beating around the bush will only lead to a calamitous outcome. The good thing is that that man has invoked both the resentment of the heavens and the rage of the people. Even though he has already made a huge concession, his ultimate demise will still be inevitable. What a pity! He could've ascended to extremely lofty heights, but instead, everything took a drastic turn for the worse for him, and his current situation is one that is truly tragic to behold. Only by taking advantage of this opportunity was I able to make some plans for your son. Now, I must see if I can put an end to that boy's life while also avoiding future repercussions by ensuring that no sages or immortals will figure out what's been done here. Only then can I ensure that this new disciple of mine will be able to ascend like the wind on his cultivation journey and ultimately rise to become a dragon.."</seg>

        <seg>Wu Yue nodded in response. "That's the correct response. While using her flying sword, the young woman had appeared to be extremely calm and collected, looking as if she had done something completely pedestrian and mundane. However, after detecting my cultivation base, she immediately decided against engaging me in battle, and she was particularly afraid that I would see through her at, so she intentionally provoked us as a form of intimidation. In reality, she was trying to defuse the situation in a roundabout way. She was afraid that I would be intent on killing her in order to eliminate her as a potential threat, which was why she felt like she had to act the way that she did. Of course, I was able to see through her guise in the end, so she didn't do as a good a job as she thought she did, but it's already quite remarkable that someone her age is so bold and cunning. However, it's exactly because of this that if she were to be left to develop unchecked, she could eventually become an extremely potent threat to you, which was why I was determined to kill her. For a girl her age, it would've been no surprise for me at all to see her rush recklessly into battle without considering hte consequences, but it's extremely abnormal that even in the face of the threat posed by me, she was able to remain so calm and calculating, killing that assassin in such a composed fashion before putting on quite a convincing act to try and fool me. This is something that can only come from extensive experience, and it has nothing to do with her aptitude. Regardelss of whehter it be among cultivators or martila artists, countless prodigies have sufferd premature demises due to various personality flaws, and certain things simply can't be taught."</seg>

        <seg>Cai Jinjian wasn't someone who was easily riled up, and she certainly wasn't a pampered littiel girl who couldn't withstand any adversity. The fact that she was able to stand out and be selected out of all of the many descendants of the master of the Dawn Cloud Mountain was a clear testament to her character. The Dawn Cloud Mountain encompassed a total of 18 peaks of different sizes, all of which were enveloped in clouds and mist all year round. The Cloud Root Stone produced on the mountain was an important material in alchemy for those following the alchemy branch of Daoism. It was renowned for its pristine purity, and it was unrivaled in that regard. Hence, ensuring cleanliness was an important priority for the people on the Dawn Cloud Mountain, and most of them had misophobia, including Cai Jinjian. If it weren't for how important this town was, she would've never set foot in this place, let alone stepped onto Clay Vase Alley, which was laden with mud and fecal matter from all types of different animals. What was most frustrating to her was that they were supposed to be high and mighty immortals, yet upon arriving in this town, they were like helpless fish that had been tossed onto the shore, losing everything that they had previously taken for granted in the blink of an eye. Their almighty clans that resided in blessed paradise, their mystical powers that allowed them to move mountains and rivers, their powerful treasures that were capable of taming demons and slaying gods, all of that had been instantly taken away from them.</seg>

        <seg>In this residence, there was only one person and one matter that could still move, Zhi Gui and the inconspicuous four-legged snake. She had noticed the abnormal situation very early on, and the first thought that had occurred to her was to go next door to look for that expressionless young girl and give her a hearty scolding. However, after noticing the existence of that sword, the maidservant gave up on this enticing thought. 

She first walked into her young master's room and shot a sideways glance at the contents of the book that he was reading. She was immediately annoyed upon seeing the words "Cao Xi", so she helped her young master flip a few pages forward. Only after seeing a paragraph about "Xie Shi" did she smile in happiness. However, she quickly flipped the book back to its initial page in a begrudging and resentful manner. This was to prevent any heavenly secrets from being revealed, and also to prevent her own secrets from being exposed. During these past years, the intelligent young master had only been suspicious of her background out of curiosity. However, he had never found any solid proof or evidence. With her grand scheme almost about to succeed, she certainly didn't want to lose everything at the final step. 

She often followed the young master to his private school, and there were some sayings of the scholars that she felt were extremely pretentious and disgraceful. For example, "one should sacrifice their life in pursuit of righteousness". However, there were also some sayings that she found quite acceptable. For example, "in a journey of 100 steps, 90 steps is only the halfway mark".  This was truly a comprehensive and easily understandable principle.</seg>

        <seg>The Daoist priest had already prepared a story, and he immediately replied, "While I was pushing my cart past the archway earlier, I spotted this young woman from out of town, and she told me that she was going to make a rubbing of the inscription on the plaque that bore the idiom of 'unmatched aura'. She had things like a rubbing pouch and a brush on her, and she quickly scaled up the archway. The act of rubbing an inscription is... How do I put this? It's basically a method of replicating a piece of calligraphy or artwork. It's something that scholars are into, and it'll take too long for me to explain to you what the process entails. In any case, after she climbed up onto the archway, she sat down onto the horizontal beam, and I was horrified for her safety, so I stopped and warned her to be careful. Much to my chagrin, she became too absorbed by her work and failed to heed my warning, ultimately falling off the archway onto the ground. As I'm sure you're aware, unlike the ground in Clay Vase Alley, the ground beneath the archway is much harder, similar to the bluestone slabs that Fortune Street is paved by, so the fall has most likely harmed even her internal organs. As a man of benevolence and upstanding character, I couldn't just leave her there, wouldn't you agree? On the way here, I asked many people to take her in, but they were all turned away by the sight of her bloodstained clothes, saying that bringing someone like her into their homes so soon after teh turn of the new year would bring bad luck to their families. While this is an understable reaction, her condition is extremley urgent and must be treated without delay. If I had any other choice, I wouldn’t have come to you. If you’re not willing to take her in, either, then I’m powerless to save her. I am but a mere mortal, not a deity with the ability to raise one from the dead. All I can do would be to accompany her in her final moments, then find a place to bury her and erect a tombstone."</seg>

She wanted me to believe that good deeds would be rewarded, while bad deeds would be punished. My mother repreated this phrase the most, so I remember it extremely clearly. There were also stories about a water ghost in the creek that would drag away children, and stories about the underworld king who would specially try cases at night near the rundown ancenstral hall in the town's north. Mother also said that the door gods plastered on the doors would actually come to life at night, helping us to protect the house. In the past, I didn't really believe these things.

Gu Can is pretty annoying at times, but I know that he didn't lie about this.

It more so isn't because I want Fu Nanhua or the Old Dragon City to feel grateful toward me and grant me favors in the future. It isn't like this. In fact, it's the complete opposite. Disciples of Confucianism advocate cultivation by engagement with society. Thus, we're most opposed to those cultivators who act with wanton disregard. The two sides have clashed openly and in secret for countless years, and if it were me from the past who had just gone to study in the Mountain Cliff Academy, how could any of them still be alive, be it the River Severing True Lord Liu Zhimao or the Old Dragon City's Young City Lord Fu Nanhua?

        <seg>There was a mother and son pair living on Clay Vase Alley, and they were completely unmatched in the town when it came to their ability to win arguments and deliver vicious insults. Only Song Jixin could compete with them in this regard. Among the pair, the child was particularly egregious. He constantly had two lines of snot trailing out of his nostrils, and he liked to catch fish and pick up rocks from the creek. All of the fish that he caught was kept in a large water vat, while the rocks that he collected were piled up next to the vat. For some reason, Song Jixin really liked to pick on the kid. Every sonce in a while, he would take a few rocks from the boy's collection, and this wasn't so apparent at first, but what was happening quickly became clear over time as Song Jixin was regularly taking rocks from the pile. Whenever the boy noticed that some of prized rocks were missing, he would fly into a rage like a wild kitten that had just had its tail trodden on, and he could stand outside Song Jixin's yard and yell profanities for two hours at a time. His mother never tried to dissuade him from this behavior. Instead, she was always eagerly fanning the flames, specifically bringing up the fact that Song Jixin was an illegitimate son of the previous kiln supervision official. On quite a few occasions, Song Jixin was so enraged by thsi pair that he had almost carried a bench outside to fight them, and Zhi Gui had to hold him back each time.</seg>
