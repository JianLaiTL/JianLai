However, this was quite a reasonable occurrence. As the saying went, the offspring of dragons and phoenixes were destined to soar in the heavens, while the offspring of mice could burrow in the dirt. Those who were traveling far away and able to send letters back to their families had to have come from privileged backgrounds. Otherwise, they wouldn't have had the courage and financial backing to go to such faraway places. For nine of the 10 letters, Chen Ping'an only had to go to two places, namely Fortune Deer Street and Peach Leaf Alley. The bluestone slabs that paved these streets were as large as bedsteads, and he felt rather uneasy as he stepped onto them for the first time.

No matter where he went, Liu Xianyang was never fazed by anything, nor did he ever feel like living alone was a bad thing. Wherever he went, he was always able to quickly make friends with whoever he met, getting on such friendly terms with them that they referred to one another as brothers and would drink and play drinking games together. Due to his grandfather's ill health, Liu Xianyang was forced to become self-dependent from a very young age, making him a leader of sorts among the children in the area. He was skilled at everything, whether it be catching snakes, fishing, procuring eggs from bird's nests, making bows, fishing rods, slingshots, bird cages... It seemed like there was nothing that he couldn't do. In particular, he was the undisputed king of the town when it came to catching catfish and fishing for eels in the channels of water running through plots of farmland. Back when Liu Xianyang dropped out of the private school, the teacher there, Mr. Xu, had paid a visit to Liu Xianyang's grandfather on his sickbed, offering to Liu Xianyang an education free of charge. However, Liu Xianyang refused to go back no matter what, telling the teacher that all he wanted to do was earn money, and that he had no interest in an education. Mr. Xu then offered Liu Xianyang a paid job as a scholarly attendant, but Liu Xianyang turned down that offer as well. As it turned out, Liu Xianyang was doing quite well for himself. Even though Old Man Yao had passed away and the dragon kilns had been shut down, it didn't take long before he caught the eye of the blacksmith from Dragon Rider Alley, and he was currently busy building his own forge in the southern part of the town.</seg>

At the moment, with the black stones, he had a roughly 50:50 chance of beating Song Jixin, and his improvement over the years was very apparent. However, Mr. Qi had never commented on the dwindling skill gap between them, and he was always watching their games in silence.</seg>

Hence, he had developed the habit of performing this type of practice whenever there was something on his mind. The crat of pottery firing was one that depended greatly on the will of the heavens.

The old people in the town warned them that those who tried to pull the chain out of the well would have one year shaved off their lifespan with each foot of chain that was pulled, but the man paid no heed to the ominous warning. After tugging vigorously on the chain for 15 minutes, a huge pile of it had been pulled out, but there was still no end in sight. At that point, the man was already completely exhausted, and he left the pile of chain next to the well winch, proclaiming that he was going to be back the next day, and that he was determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. However, on the very same day after he returned home, he died on his bed, bleeding out of all of his orifices, and he refused to close his eyes in death. No matter what his family members tried, they were unable to get his corpse to close its eyes. In the end, an old man whose family had lived near the well for generations instructed that family to carry the corpse over to the well so that it could "watch" the old man return the chain back into the well. Finally, after the entire chain had sunk down into the depths, the body finally closed its eyes.</seg>

        <seg>However, after that incident, not only was Liu Xianyang not grateful to the child that saved his life, he regularly came over to bully the child instead. The child was an orphan, and he was very stubborn, refusing to cry no matter how much he was bullied, something that only served to further infuriate Liu Xianyang. One year, Liu Xianyang could tell that the little orphan most likely wasn't going to be able to make it through the winter, and he was finally stung by his conscience. Having already become a disciple of Old Man Yao's at the time, he took the young boy to the dragon kiln that was situated beside Treasure Creek. They headed west out of the town, traveling over dozens of kilometers of rugged mountain terrain under heavy snowfall. To this day, Liu Xianyang still couldn't understand how the emaciated young boy with a pair of legs as thin as baby bamboo shoots had managed to walk all the way to the dragon kiln. Even though Old Man Yao ultimately took in Chen Ping'an, the disparity in his treatment of the two boys was night and day. Even as his best disciple, Liu Xianyang wasn't spared from his beatings and insults, but even a blind man could sense the good intentions behind Old Man Yao's words and actions. For example, there was one time when he went a little too far, inflicting a bleeding gash onto Liu Xianyang's forehead. As a tough young boy, Liu Xianyang didn't think much of this, but Old Man Yao was feeling very remorseful over his actions. However, he had always kept up a stern and authoritative facade in front of his disciples, so he couldn't bring himself to apologize or enquire about his condition. In the end, he paced back and forht in his own room for almost an entire night, and he was still concerned about Liu Xianyang. Finally, he had no choice but to call over Chen Ping'an to deliver a bottle of ointment to Liu Xianyang.</seg>

He wasn't like the high and mighty officials that came before him. He didn't hide away in his official manor to work on personal cultivation, nor did he turn away all visitors and focus solely on reading and self-education. Instead, he always attended to matters related to the creation of imperial ware in person, and he was even more like a commoner than the potters working at the kilns. During the dozen or so years in which he was at the town, his original scholarly appearance had been replaced by a dark tan, and his regular attire was no different from what was worn by the men working in the fields. He never put on a high and mighty front when dealing with others, but unfortunately, the imperial ware fired using the dragon kilns in the town were never quite up to standard, regardless of whether it was in terms of shape and form, or their coloration and glaze.

        <seg>The young boy's name was Chen Ping'an, and both his parents had passed away at a very early stage in his life. The town that he lived in was extremely renowned for producing chinaware. Ever since the founding of the nation, the town had taken on the important task of producing chinaware to be offered to the imperial court, and there were imperial officials constantly stationed in the town, overseeing the operation of the official kilns. Without any parents to rely on, Chen Ping'an became a potter at a very young age. In the beginning, he was only able to perform some menial tasks and manual labor, toiling away arduously for several years under a reluctant master with a terrible temper. In a cruel twist of fate, just when he had begun to grasp some of the basics of pottery firing, the town suddenly lost the right to host official kilns. Over the course of just a single night, all of the dozens of coiling-dragon-like kilns throughout the town were ordered to be shut down by the authorities.</seg>

        <seg>In the end, the imperial court most likely felt like Master Song's efforts were very commendable, even though the outcome wasn't ideal, and he was given a decent evaluation on the documentation from the Ministry of Personnel summoning him back to the capital. Prior to returning to the capital, Master Song spent all of his money to fund the construction of a covered bridge. After that, it was discovered that a certain child wasn't brought along on the convoy that Master Song had departed in, and the most affluent clans in the town immediately realized what this entailed. It could be said that Master Song had accumulated a great deal of good karma in the town, and in addition to that, Song Jixin was being looked after by Master Song's kiln supervision official successor, so he didn't have to worry about food, clothing, or shelter, and led a carefree life. As for his maidservant, whose name had been changed to Zhi Gui, there were many different theories and stories about her origins. The local residents of Clay Vase Alley claimed that she was a little beggar from out of town that had come to this place on a snowy winter's day. She had fallen unconcious in front of hte entrance of Song Jixin's courtyard, and if she hadn't been discovered in time, she would've already passed on to the afterlife. The old man taking care of menial chores at the official manor had a different story. He proclaimed with great confidence that she was an orphan that Master Song had purchased quite some time ago so that his illegitimate son, Song Jixin, would have an intimitate companion, and that he had done this to compensate for leaving his son behind.</seg>

Song Jixin often said some things that were very difficult to understand. He most likely took those esoteric sayings from the books that he read, and Chen Ping'an was often left scratching his head in befuddlement. For example, a few days ago, Song Jixin had been saying something something along the lines of "beware of the spring chill, for it has been the death of many a young man", and Chen Ping'an had no idea what that meant. However, he had first-hand experience of the strange phenomenon where the initial period of spring felt colder than the winter each year. Song Jixin referred to this phenomenon as the unexpected spring chill, which caught many people off guard before claiming their lives, much like a sudden and unforeseen retaliation from an opponent on the battlefield.</seg>

Never would I have imagined that I would develop an idea of what those concepts are after stepping on a pile of dog excrement on your Clay Vase Alley..."</seg>

        <seg>Cai Jinjian wasn't someone who was easily riled up, and she certainly wasn't a pampered littiel girl who couldn't withstand any adversity. The fact that she was able to stand out and be selected out of all of the many descendants of the master of the Dawn Cloud Mountain was a clear testament to her character. The Dawn Cloud Mountain encompassed a total of 18 peaks of different sizes, all of which were enveloped in clouds and mist all year round. The Cloud Root Stone produced on the mountain was an important material in alchemy for those following the alchemy branch of Daoism. It was renowned for its pristine purity, and it was unrivaled in that regard. Hence, ensuring cleanliness was an important priority for the people on the Dawn Cloud Mountain, and most of them had misophobia, including Cai Jinjian. If it weren't for how important this town was, she would've never set foot in this place, let alone stepped onto Clay Vase Alley, which was laden with mud and fecal matter from all types of different animals. What was most frustrating to her was that they were supposed to be high and mighty immortals, yet upon arriving in this town, they were like helpless fish that had been tossed onto the shore, losing everything that they had previously taken for granted in the blink of an eye. Their almighty clans that resided in blessed paradise, their mystical powers that allowed them to move mountains and rivers, their powerful treasures that were capable of taming demons and slaying gods, all of that had been instantly taken away from them.</seg>

In the simple and unsophisticated small town, it was difficult to spend a lot of money even if one wanted to. Over the years, Song Jixin really had developed a hobby of collecting all types of trinkets. He had a large red crate that was filled with all types of interesting obscure items like that the green gourd, but Song Jixin had a profound and inexplicable feeling that out of all of the items in the crate, of which there were around three dozens, the gourd was the most important one, followed by a rusty violet gold bell. When shaken, it could be clearly seen that the clapper of the bell was clattering against its inner wall, so it should've produced a chime, but it was completely silent. This phenomenon bot terrified and fascinated Song Jixin. The only other artifact worthy of note was an old teapot with the word "mandrill" inscribed upon it.

He also tried filling it with water and sand before pouring it out, and the exact same amount of water and sand would be come out. Thus, he could only set it aside again.

After that, your Dawn Cloud Mountain will offer up Cloud Root Stones equivalent to half the value of those items. Do you have any objections to this, Cai Jinjian? In other words, what I'm saying is that after you agree to this proposal and obtain what you came here to acquire, are you certain that you'll be able to convince the patriarchs of Dawn Cloud Mountain to agree to the terms of this bet?"</seg>

According to our pre-established agreement, there are two families of interest on this Clay Vase Alley, one of which is a master and his maidservant, while the other one is a mother and her son. I can let you choose one of the two, and in exchange, each year, you'll be giving our Old Dragon City 10 pieces of Cloud Root Stones, the specialty product of your Dawn Cloud Mountain.

This may only be a small town, but it's like a small puddle that appears to be innocuous from the outside, but actually holds unfathomably deep water. Those who strike us with a sense of foreboding are most likely going to be our opponents that we'll be competing with in our search for treasures in this town. As for those who evoke a sense of affinity within us, those are people who are most likely blessed with fortune and can potentially present opportunities for us to further ourselves. All we have to do is refrain from killing people as much as possible and avoid breaking those old rules that are set in stone. Aside from that, we can do whatever we please, whether that be swindling others out of their treasures, or simply taking them by force."</seg>
