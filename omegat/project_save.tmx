Back when our Sun Scorch Mountain was at its weakest and most vulnerable point, she courageously challenged the master of the Wind Lightning Field at the time, and she perished in a fair and square battle. However, not only was her body not sent back by the Wind Lightning Field to be buried on our Sun Scorch Mountain, it was simply left exposed to the elements, and there's even a longsword from a Wind Lightning Field swordsman plunged into her head, making her a spectacle to be laughed at by the entire Wind Lightning Field! It's been 300 years, and even though our Sun Scorch Mountain has been publicly acknowledged as a sect that produces an abundance of prodigious talent, we still haven't been able to pull out that single sword! Generations after generations, all of the sword cultivators of our Sun Scorch Mountain are forced to bear this humiliation. As long as the Wind Lightning Field still stands, our Sun Scorch Mountain will remain the laughingstock of the entire Eastern Treasured Vial Continent! Why is it that not a single one of our Sun Scorch Mountain's sword immortals ever held celebratory ceremonies after reaching the lofty heights of becoming a Sword Immortal?"</seg>

Wherever he went, he was always able to quickly make friends with whoever he met, getting on such friendly terms with them that they referred to one another as brothers and would drink and play drinking games together. Due to his grandfather's ill health, Liu Xianyang was forced to become self-dependent from a very young age, making him a leader of sorts among the children in the area. He was skilled at everything, whether it be catching snakes, fishing, procuring eggs from bird's nests, making bows, fishing rods, slingshots, bird cages... It seemed like there was nothing that he couldn't do. In particular, he was the undisputed king of the town when it came to catching catfish and fishing for eels in the channels of water running through plots of farmland. Back when Liu Xianyang dropped out of the private school, the teacher there, Mr. Xu, had paid a visit to Liu Xianyang's grandfather on his sickbed, offering to Liu Xianyang an education free of charge. However, Liu Xianyang refused to go back no matter what, telling the teacher that all he wanted to do was earn money, and that he had no interest in an education. Mr. Xu then offered Liu Xianyang a paid job as a scholarly attendant, but Liu Xianyang turned down that offer as well. As it turned out, Liu Xianyang was doing quite well for himself. Even though Old Man Yao had passed away and the dragon kilns had been shut down, it didn't take long before he caught the eye of the blacksmith from Dragon Rider Alley, and he was currently busy building his own forge in the southern part of the town.</seg>

Throughout the extensive history of the Dawn Cloud Mountain, there had been precedents of women becoming the master of the mountain. If everything went according to plan, the Old Dragon City would have a legitimate reason to infiltrate the central area of the Eastern Treasured Vial Continent, forming an alliance with the Dawn Cloud Mountain in the north.

        <seg>However, after that incident, not only was Liu Xianyang not grateful to the child that saved his life, he regularly came over to bully the child instead. The child was an orphan, and he was very stubborn, refusing to cry no matter how much he was bullied, something that only served to further infuriate Liu Xianyang. One year, Liu Xianyang could tell that the little orphan most likely wasn't going to be able to make it through the winter, and he was finally stung by his conscience. Having already become a disciple of Old Man Yao's at the time, he took the young boy to the dragon kiln that was situated beside Treasure Creek. They headed west out of the town, traveling over dozens of kilometers of rugged mountain terrain under heavy snowfall. To this day, Liu Xianyang still couldn't understand how the emaciated young boy with a pair of legs as thin as baby bamboo shoots had managed to walk all the way to the dragon kiln. Even though Old Man Yao ultimately took in Chen Ping'an, the disparity in his treatment of the two boys was night and day. Even as his best disciple, Liu Xianyang wasn't spared from his beatings and insults, but even a blind man could sense the good intentions behind Old Man Yao's words and actions. For example, there was one time when he went a little too far, inflicting a bleeding gash onto Liu Xianyang's forehead. As a tough young boy, Liu Xianyang didn't think much of this, but Old Man Yao was feeling very remorseful over his actions. However, he had always kept up a stern and authoritative facade in front of his disciples, so he couldn't bring himself to apologize or enquire about his condition. In the end, he paced back and forht in his own room for almost an entire night, and he was still concerned about Liu Xianyang. Finally, he had no choice but to call over Chen Ping'an to deliver a bottle of ointment to Liu Xianyang.</seg>

        <seg>Liu Xianyang was Old Man Yao's best disciple. As for Chen Ping'an, Old Man Yao had never truly accepted him as a disciple due to his mediocre aptitude for the craft. According to local traditions, no master and disciple relationship could be established unless the disciple offered a cup of tea to the master in a formal ceremony, and the master accepted and drank the cup of tea. Chen Ping'an and Liu Xianyang weren't neighbors. In fact, their ancestral homes were quite far away from one another's. The reason why Liu Xianyang had recommended Chen Ping'an to Old Man Yao stemmed from their past history. Liu Xianyang was once a renowned delinquent in the town. Prior to the passing of his grandfather, there was at least an adult in the household to keep him in check, but after his grandfather passed away due to illness, Liu Xianyang quickly became an absolute nightmare for his neighbors. At the time, he was only 12 or 13 years old, but he was already no less physically developed than a young man, and one time, he somehow made enemies out of a group of boys from the Lu Family. As a result, he was ganged up on in Clay Vase Alley and handed a vicious beating. His assailants were all young boys who didn't think about the consequences of their actions, and Liu Xianyang was quickly beaten to hte point where he was throwing up blood. All of the dozen or so clans that resided in Clay Vase Alley were bottom-class potters who made a living by working at small dragon kilns, and they didn't dare to intervene.</seg>

        <seg>Lu Zhengchun watched as Liu Xianyang drew closer and closer to the covered bridge, and a sense of fierce resentment suddenly welled up in his heart. Liu Xianyang was nothing more than a piece of low-class scum that had once almost been beaten to death like a stray dog by him and his lackeys. If it weren't for that meddlig little bastard who had run out onto the street and called for help, he and his lackeys were already preparing to enact the punishment that they had agreed upon in advance, taking off their pants to give the arrogant young man a warm shower. Even now, Lu Zhengchun still couldn't understand why these high and mighty individuals had taken such a liking to Liu Xianyang. As for certain things that they mentioned like prized armor, sword scripture, Sun Scorch Mountain, the Great Dao to immortality, and fighting over resources and opportunities, Liu Xianyang could understand everything, but at the the same time, he had no idea what they were talking about.</seg>

        <seg>Lu Zhengchun and the others were much more unrestrained, so they naturally didn't like to hang out with a righteous bookworm like Zhao Yao either. After all, one could just imagine a scenario where they were all excitedly climbing on a wall to perve on beautiful woman. Yet, someone would suddenly walk up beside them and say that one should not look at that which is improper. Just how much of a turn off would that be? 

In any case, Zhao Yao also liked to interact with people outside Fortune Street. During the past few years, he had visited almost all of the alleys, big or small. The only exception was the Clay Vase Alley. This was because Song Jixin lived in this valley — this was someone at the same age as him who caused him to feel a sense of shame and inferiority.</seg>

He carefully thought back to everything he had done after arriving in the town, and he concluded that there shouldn't have been anything amiss about his alliance with Cai Jinjian or his transaction with Song Jixin. Everything that he had done up to this point had been within the rules, so it didn't make sense for the enigmatic Sage in this town to interfere. In that case, where was this pressure coming from? Could it have been coming from the River Severing True Lord, someone that he hadn't even heard of before this point? In contrast with Fu Nanhua, who was considering multiple possibilities, Cai Jinjian's thought process was far more straightforward. She simply thought that Fu Nanhua had been correct in his assessment of his situation, and that the River Severing True Lord really had used some type of mystical ability to conduct surveillance on her. As soon as this thought occurred to her, a hint of lingering fear welled up in her heart, and she was feeling very thankful that she had only complained about the situation, but hadn't said anything direspectful about the River Severing True Lord.</seg>

        <seg>Chen Ping'an was actually quite similar to Zhi Gui in this regard. What was different in his case was that even though he also didn't like to speak much, his personality definitely didn't turn people away from him. In fact, he was naturally very friendly and approchable, and he was like a smooth stone that didn't possess any sharp edges. It was only due to the unfortunate circumstances of his upbringing and the fact that he had gone to work at the dragon kiln from a young age that he wasn't all that close and familiar with his neighbors. Of course, in addition to that, all of his neighbors on Clay Vase Alley were also a little wary of his birth date, regardless of whether they were willing to admit it or not. According to the superstitions in the town, the fifth day of the fifth month was considered to be an ominous day during which the five poisons, namely centipedes, snakes, scorpions, geckos, and toads, all came out to spread disease and misfortune. That, in addition to the fact that his parents had passed away while he was still at a very young age, inevitably made it so that there was a negative stigma surrounding him. In particular, the old people who liked to gather under the old locust tree would always intentionally distance themselves from Chen Ping'an and encourage their grandchildren and great grandchildren to do the same. However, whenever those children asked why they should stay away from Chen Ping'an, those old people would be unable to give an explanation.</seg>

The punish wasn't very severe, but it wasn't just going to be a light punishment, either. If an outsider were to kill any of the mortal residents of the town, they would be evicted without exception, but there were loopholes to be exploited when it came to battles between outsiders, and for three of the groups of outsiders who had entered the town, including Gao Zhen's, they had all brought "servants" with them precisely because they knew that there was a chance that this rule could be broken. In the case that the rule was broken, they would be able to use their servants as scapegoats and place the blamd squarely on them. It had cost half of the wealth saved up in the imperial vault of the Great Sui Nation's emperor just to earn entry for a single person into the town. The imperial vault contained what was essentially the emperor's private stash, so half of the wealth in the entire vault was naturally an exorbitant amount. If it weren't for the possibility that battles could break out between the factions of outsiders entering the town, there was no way that Wu Yue would've been sent in alongside Gao Zhen.</seg>

His thin blanket didn't do a very good job of keeping him warm, and he had developed the habit of waking up early and going to bed late back when he was learning to become a potter. He opened the door before stepping out onto the soft and loamy soil in the courtyard outside, then took a deep breath. After stretching out his body, he made his way out of the courtyard and turned to discover a thin and frail figure. It was none other than Song Jixin's maidservant, and she huddled over, trying to open the gate of the neighboring courtyard with her shoulder while carrying a bucket of water with both hands. It seemed that she had just drawn some water from the Iron Lock Well in Apricot Blossom Valley.</seg>

        <seg>The woman faltered slightly upon hearing this, then smoothed down her hair with her hands momentarily before beginning her story. “The name of that poor boy is Chen Ping’an. Both his parents grew up in the town, and I was very close with his mother. She wasn’t particularly beautiful, but she had a fantastic personality. I don’t think I can recall an instance where she ever became angry at anyone. Her husband was far from a handsome man, and to be honest, I don’t think he was good enough for her, but he was a decent potter. If he hadn’t died so young, perhaps he would’ve been able to become the head potter at a large dragon kiln in 20 years. As for how he died, some say that on a certain rainy day, he was worried that the flame in the kilns would be snuffed out, and in his haste to get to the kilns, he slipped and fell into the creek. Others say that while out in the forest securing firewood one day, his greed got the better of him, and he trespassed onto a mountain that was sealed off by the imperial court and fell pretty to some wild beasts. In any case, his body was never found. That man had a really quite and withdrawn personality, but he was really good to his son. Whenever he returned to the town, he would always bring some small gifts like little pellet drums, candy Bodhisattva figures, or old porcelain fragments. Before he passed away, the family of three had a pretty stable life. After Chen Ping’an’s father passed away, the grief was too much for his mother to bear, and she fell ill almost overnight. Over the course of less than a year, she was so tormented by her illness that she had been reduced to nothing more than a sack of skin and bones. At the time, her neighbors and I were terrified to see her, and she was just a shell of the bubbly and outgoing woman that everyone knew and loved. During that time, Chen Ping’an looked after her. He was just a wee little child back then, but he did everything, including buying and brewing medicine, and cooking for his mother and himself. He was so short back then that he had to stand on a stool while cooking just to reach countertop, and in order to save money on medicinal ingredients, he would go all over the mountain searching for the more common medicinal ingredients. If he had any leftover, he would sell it all to the medicine shop. One time, he presumably ate the wrong medicinal herb by accident while exploring the mountains, and upon returning to the town, he suddenly collapsed to the ground and began frothing at the mouth while rolling around as if he had been possessed. We were terrified at the time, thinking that this would be the end of their family. At the time, my mother-in-law was still alive, and she said that it would be a blessing for all three of them to pass on like this so that no one would have to remain in this world and suffer alone. At the very least, they would be able to reunite in the afterlife. However, Chen Ping’an was somehow able to survive that ordeal on his own, but his mother was unable to live through the winter. Oh, that reminds me, Chen Ping’an was born on the fifth day of the fifth month. All of the older people in our alley say that this is the most unlucky day of the year, and those who are born on that day will not only lead miserable lives, they’ll bring misfortune upon their families as well. After his parents passed away, there was not a single copper coin left in their house. Even the small gifts that his father had brought back for him had all been exchanged for food with the other children in the town.”</seg>

        <seg>There was a restaurant in the small town, and it was just that it truly wasn't very big. Even so, it was no cheap place to go. However, Zhao Yao was a member of the Zhao Clan, after all, and he also had a very good reputation. Thus, for some unknown reason, the restaurant manager who was renowned for his stinginess patted his chest and declared that he wouldn't take a single copper coin from them. Moreover, he said that it was the restaurant's honor for these two students to visit and have a drink. Instead of him accepting payment, it was him who should have been paying them. Song Jixin immediately chuckled and held out his hand upon hearing this, asking for a few silver coins. The manager had no option but to huff and back down, saying that he would give it to them some other time. He would send someone over to give Song Jixin a few jars of good wine tomorrow. Throughout this exchange, Zhao Yao wanted to find a hole in the ground to crawl into. Howeve, the restaraunt manager knew about Song Jixin's strange temperament, so he didn't get angry about it either. Instead, he personally led the three of them upstairs to a quiet and elegant table near the window.</seg>

        <seg>There weren't any important figures in the town, nor were there any exciting events. Hence, the kiln supervision official sent by the imperial court naturally became the most prominent figure in the town, much like the all-powerful decision makers seen in stageplays. Out of the dozens of kiln supervision officials that had been assigned to the town throughout history, Master Song was the most popular with the people. He wasn't like the high and mighty officials that came before him. He didn't hide away in his official manor to work on personal cultivation, nor did he turn away all visitors and focus solely on reading and self-education. Instead, he always attended to matters related to the creation of imperial ware in person, and he was even more like a commoner than the potters working at the kilns. During the dozen or so years in which he was at the town, his original scholarly appearance had been replaced by a dark tan, and his regular attire was no different from what was worn by the men working in the fields. He never put on a high and mighty front when dealing with others, but unfortunately, the imperial ware fired using the dragon kilns in the town were never quite up to standard, regardless of whether it was in terms of shape and form, or their coloration and glaze. In fact, the imperial ware that was produced had regressed compared with before, much to the puzzlement of the old kiln masters. </seg>

Mr. Qi was normally quite stern and strict in his demeanor, but for some reason, he was looking a lot more relaxed on this day, and began to tell many interesting stories to his student. "At the time, the one who inscribed the idiom of 'doing my part' on this plaque was considered to be the number one calligrapher under the heavens, and he stirred up many debates, such as the fundamental conflict between structure and freedom of expression, as well as the merits of calligraphy from past and present eras. To this day, those debates still haven't been settled. Spirit, method, meaning, form; those are the four fundamental elements of calligrapy. For many years, this man reigned supreme in all aspects of calligraphy, completely dominating all of the other calligraphy masters of his time. As for the idiom 'comply with the natural order', there's an interesting story behind that as well. If you look closely, you'll find that even though the technique, structure, and expression of the four characters are all very similar, in reality, each character was inscribed by a different ist master. At the time, there were two of them who were exchanging letters back and forth, arguing about which character would be assigned to them. Both of them wanted to inscribe the more profound of the two characters, while netihger of the were willing to settle for hte more mundane of the two."</seg>

Thus, when he flipped through it again, like he was now, he would only choose the most bizarre and interesting stories to read. He would treat these stories as legends shared by storytellers, with their aunthenticity unable to be verified. Of course, Song Jixin didn't care much for this either.  He only remembered the events that had occurred late that one night. Before that man in his official garb was about to return to the capital to report on his work, he had come to speak with Song Jixin in an extremely solemn manner. He had told the young boy to keep one thing firmly in mind. That was, he needed to memorize every single person who had appeared in the Local County Chronicle. In addition to this, he needed to remember the roots of these hundreds of thousands of people and their ancestors, especially those who were related to the Four Surnames and Ten Clans.</seg>

How dare you speak of sincerity when you're clearly trying to commit daylight robbery!"</seg>

The exposed tip of the porcelain shard was extremely sharp, and his hand was covered in blood. It was unclear whether the blood belonged to Cai Jinjian, or was the result of the porcelain shard piercing into the palm of his hand. After looking around to ensure that there was no one else nearby, Fu Nanhua was struck by a sense of absurdity, but at the same time, he also felt as if a heavy load had been lifted off his shoulders. In the end, his gaze fell upon Cai Jinjian. Even in her terrible condition, her natural beauty was still very apparent. Her voluptuous chest was rising and falling ever so slightly, while blood was gushing incessantly out of her neck and mouth. Her life was about to come to an end, but due to how resilient her body was from her years of cultivation, she was going to suffer a more painful and prolonged death than the average person would in her condition.</seg>

I'm going to tell you three things that you must make sure to remember. The first thing is that once Ning Yao is in better condition, take her to the creek south of the town and look for a father and daughter with the Ruan surname. Make sure to take Ning Yao with you. Otherwise, if you go on your own, you can visit them 100 times, and they still won't agree to meet you. After you get there, no matter what you have to do, whether that be beg and grovel, or just be shameless and refuse to leave, you have to convince them to accept you as an apprentice or a manual laborer. Regardless of whether you'll be assigned to digging wells or forging swords, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that you get them to take you under their wing. After that, Ning Yao will have repaid her debt to you as well, so don't feel like your taking advantage of her. The second thing is that after the fifth day of hte fifth month, you must make frequent visits to hte creek under the covered bridge. It doesn't matter what you do there, whether it be collecting rocks or cathching fish, the key is to visit the creek often. It's even more important that you visit the creek when you're in a bad mood or you sense something a little different from usual. As for what rewards you'll reap from those visits, given your terrible luck, I wouldn't be too optimistic, but you can only hope that yoyr diligence ca make up for your other shortcomings. If you still don't reap any rewards even after visiting the creek as much as possible, then you'll just have to accept your fate."</seg>

Thus, he removed the cotton blanket draped over his cart, revealing a young woman in black laying on her side in a fetal position. Her veiled hat was sitting on her head on a very crooked angle, but it was still stubbornly concealing her face. As soon as the thin blanket was lifted, the smell of blood instantly began to waft through the air, and only then did Chen Ping'an notice that there was blood seeping through her black attire. Instead of pausing to consider how such a small and thin blanket had managed to mask such a strong scent of blood, Chen Ping'an hurriedly took a few steps backward as he asked, "What is the meaning of this?"</seg>

Given the slower acting nature of the medicine, it'll take a little longer for Ning Yao to make a full recovery, so more medicinal ingredients will have to be purchased than otherwise, but that's just a matter of money. I've written down when the medicines needs to be brought up to a boil over a high flame, and when it needs to be brought down to a simmer over a low flame, as well as when the medicine needs to be brewed and consumed.

I can't give you that bamboo tube and the 108 slips as the causality would be too chaotic, and they would be more trouble than they're woth in your hands. As ofr my private seal, that's a bit too hefty a gift to give. If the formation is removed, the entire town would be completely exposed, and I would be doing you a massive disserice rathre than helping you. Will I have to resrot to giving you money as a parting gift? That would be way too vulgar and tacky, I simply wouldn't be able to live with myself..."</seg>

However, no one experiencing any actual troubles would be willing to come here just to be scalped. It would be unfair to say that the ist priest was a complete an utter fraud. The town was not a very large place, and if all he did was intentionally confuse and defraud people, then he would've been kicked out long ago. Hence, it was clear that the young ist priest's forte wasn't his fortune telling.

He was able to discover many patterns, such as how this book was approximately appended to and edited once every 60 years. Thus, Song Jixin privately referred to this book as the "Sixty-Year Chronicle". Something else he noticed was that those who were brought out of the small town by distant relatives at a young age would almost never return. It was as if they didn't like returning to their hometown — they were like flowers that bloomed inside the town, yet whose fragrance could only be enjoyed outside. Indeed, it was in this manner that many clans and families took root and grew in the outside world. In fact, some of them even grew into towering trees with deep and strudy roots.

        <seg>As one of the narrowest alleys in the entire town, the Daoist priest's cart couldn't just be left outside Chen Ping'an's yard as it would present a major hindrance to everyone trying to walk through the alley. Thankfully, even though Chen Ping'an appeared to be quite thin and lacking in physical strength, he was much stronger than he looked, and it didn't take him much effort at all to help the Daoist priest move the rather heavy cart into his yard. Throughout this entire process, Chen Ping'an didn't say anything, and that left the young Daoist priest feeling rather awkward after he closed the gate of the yard behind him. It was like he had visited someone with the intention of borrowing money from them, only for the host to welcome him with open arms and exceptional hospitality, leaving him too ashamed to ask for money.</seg>

Song Jixin often said some things that were very difficult to understand.

For example, a few days ago, Song Jixin had been saying something something along the lines of "beware of the spring chill, for it has been the death of many a young man", and Chen Ping'an had no idea what that meant. However, he had first-hand experience of the strange phenomenon where the initial period of spring felt colder than the winter each year. Song Jixin referred to this phenomenon as the unexpected spring chill, which caught many people off guard before claiming their lives, much like a sudden and unforeseen retaliation from an opponent on the battlefield.</seg>

If the gods take a liking to someone, even a stray dog on the side of the road or a weed can eventually embark on the path of cultivation and ultimately ascend to the heavens. On this occasion, the town had no choice but to break past conventions and allow so many outsiders in at once. No matter how good a plot of farmland is, after being plowed and harvested without pause for thousands of years and going through multiple ordeals where excessive harvests were made without consideration for the consequences, the land will inevitably degrade and become infertile. This place has finally reached its final harvest. Whenever someone is about to die and experiences a brief revival right before the end, their energy, essence, and spirit will all be elevated to an unprecedented peak. Gu Can is benefitting from this phenomenon right as we speak, and this is far more massive an opportunity than you can imagine.

        <seg>Wu Yue nodded in response. "That's the correct response. While using her flying sword, the young woman had appeared to be extremely calm and collected, looking as if she had done something completely pedestrian and mundane. However, after detecting my cultivation base, she immediately decided against engaging me in battle, and she was particularly afraid that I would see through her at, so she intentionally provoked us as a form of intimidation. In reality, she was trying to defuse the situation in a roundabout way. She was afraid that I would be intent on killing her in order to eliminate her as a potential threat, which was why she felt like she had to act the way that she did. Of course, I was able to see through her guise in the end, so she didn't do as a good a job as she thought she did, but it's already quite remarkable that someone her age is so bold and cunning. However, it's exactly because of this that if she were to be left to develop unchecked, she could eventually become an extremely potent threat to you, which was why I was determined to kill her. For a girl her age, it would've been no surprise for me at all to see her rush recklessly into battle without considering hte consequences, but it's extremely abnormal that even in the face of the threat posed by me, she was able to remain so calm and calculating, killing that assassin in such a composed fashion before putting on quite a convincing act to try and fool me. This is something that can only come from extensive experience, and it has nothing to do with her aptitude. Regardelss of whehter it be among cultivators or martila artists, countless prodigies have sufferd premature demises due to various personality flaws, and certain things simply can't be taught."</seg>

There was one time when Old Man Yao became so disgusted by how little talent and aptitude Chen Ping'an had that he abandoned him in the wilderness in a fit of rage before returning to the kiln alone. By the time Chen Ping'an navigated the 60 kilometers of mountain terrain back to the dragon kiln, it was already very late at night. It had been raining heavily that day, and after finally spotting a hint of light in the distance after trudging through the mud for hours, the stubborn and resilient Chen Ping'an was struck by the urge to cry for the first time.</seg>

        <seg>Zhao Yao was the eldest grandson of one of the four major clans, and compared to the profligate youths of similar backgrounds such as Lu Zhengchun and the others, his reputation was by far better. Many old and lonely people had received his help before. If one were to accuse him of "purposefully cultivating his reputation for ulterior motives", this would seemingly be an overestimation of Zhao Yao's ambitions. It would also be an act of degrading his character. After all, he had already been a kind-hearted and amiable person since he was 10 years old. He had maintained this kindness year after year, not changing in the least. Even the elderly citizens of Fortune Street who had watched him grow up would stick their thumbs up in praise. Every time they scolded their children and the younger generation, they would use Zhao Yao as an example of what they should be like. This caused Zhao Yao to have few close friends at the same age as him.</seg>

        <seg>In this residence, there was only one person and one matter that could still move, Zhi Gui and the inconspicuous four-legged snake. She had noticed the abnormal situation very early on, and the first thought that had occurred to her was to go next door to look for that expressionless young girl and give her a hearty scolding. However, after noticing the existence of that sword, the maidservant gave up on this enticing thought. 

She first walked into her young master's room and shot a sideways glance at the contents of the book that he was reading. She was immediately annoyed upon seeing the words "Cao Xi", so she helped her young master flip a few pages forward. Only after seeing a paragraph about "Xie Shi" did she smile in happiness. However, she quickly flipped the book back to its initial page in a begrudging and resentful manner. This was to prevent any heavenly secrets from being revealed, and also to prevent her own secrets from being exposed. During these past years, the intelligent young master had only been suspicious of her background out of curiosity. However, he had never found any solid proof or evidence. With her grand scheme almost about to succeed, she certainly didn't want to lose everything at the final step. 

She often followed the young master to his private school, and there were some sayings of the scholars that she felt were extremely pretentious and disgraceful. For example, "one should sacrifice their life in pursuit of righteousness". However, there were also some sayings that she found quite acceptable. For example, "in a journey of 100 steps, 90 steps is only the halfway mark".  This was truly a comprehensive and easily understandable principle.</seg>

        <seg>The Daoist priest had already prepared a story, and he immediately replied, "While I was pushing my cart past the archway earlier, I spotted this young woman from out of town, and she told me that she was going to make a rubbing of the inscription on the plaque that bore the idiom of 'unmatched aura'. She had things like a rubbing pouch and a brush on her, and she quickly scaled up the archway. The act of rubbing an inscription is... How do I put this? It's basically a method of replicating a piece of calligraphy or artwork. It's something that scholars are into, and it'll take too long for me to explain to you what the process entails. In any case, after she climbed up onto the archway, she sat down onto the horizontal beam, and I was horrified for her safety, so I stopped and warned her to be careful. Much to my chagrin, she became too absorbed by her work and failed to heed my warning, ultimately falling off the archway onto the ground. As I'm sure you're aware, unlike the ground in Clay Vase Alley, the ground beneath the archway is much harder, similar to the bluestone slabs that Fortune Street is paved by, so the fall has most likely harmed even her internal organs. As a man of benevolence and upstanding character, I couldn't just leave her there, wouldn't you agree? On the way here, I asked many people to take her in, but they were all turned away by the sight of her bloodstained clothes, saying that bringing someone like her into their homes so soon after teh turn of the new year would bring bad luck to their families. While this is an understable reaction, her condition is extremley urgent and must be treated without delay. If I had any other choice, I wouldn’t have come to you. If you’re not willing to take her in, either, then I’m powerless to save her. I am but a mere mortal, not a deity with the ability to raise one from the dead. All I can do would be to accompany her in her final moments, then find a place to bury her and erect a tombstone."</seg>

However, out of the corner of his eyes, he was secretly stealing glances at the side figure of a shapely village woman.

Her curves seemed slightly exaggerated, and her shapely figure was exposed for all to see. Her movements more so highlighted her slightly unruly nature that was just like the swaying plump ear of wheat. This caused the woman who only had a middling appearance to radiate with a different kind of charm. When the young man finally noticed the eerie silence and stillness in the surroundings, he didn't choose to move either.

Gu Can is pretty annoying at times, but I know that he didn't lie about this.

        <seg>A slightly dejected look surfaced in Chen Ping'an's eyes as he replied, "In the past, I was unable to figure it out no matter how much I thought about it, but later, Liu Xianyang told me something that Old Man Yao told him, which was that in order to execute the jumping burin technique well, one has to have a steady heart, not just a steady hand. After that, I began to understand what I was doing wrong. In the past, I was too hasty, and the more hasty I was, the less steady my hands were, the more mistakes I made. After making mistakes, I would become even more dismayed because I knew what I was doing wasn't like Old Man Yao at all, and it was a negative cycle that compounded on itself. That's why I was always the worst at pottery molding at the dragon kiln."</seg>

He had heard that those large families were extremely strict. Liu Xianyang and Song Jixin always liked to disagree with each other, but when it came to this matter, they were suprisingly united in agreement. However, Liu Xianyang's explanation had been especially frightening. He said that inside the tall walls of those homes, the maidservants would be watched like prey by the hawk-eyed housekeepers. If their manner of walking was off by just a little, the housekeepers would immediately command someone to break their legs and toss them outside, where they would wait for death to arrive. However, Song Jixin had accused Liu Xianyang of false information, saying that it wasn't so extreme. Even so, he agreed that the maidservants in these large families did indeed have to tip toe around like cats. They weren't allowed to make any sound when they walked. Upon seeing Zhi Gui secretly chuckling in delight, Liu Xianyang's embarrassment had immediately turned into anger, causing him to curse at Song Jixin.</seg>

In fact, Qi Jingchun wouldn't have been surprised if this were to become an internal demon in his Dao Heart. If that were to happen, then it wouldn't just be Fu Nanhua hunting down Chen Ping'an.

As a result, he naturally became worthless in the eyes of those who had invested in him, and was viewed as a financial loss. Perhaps they were angered, or perhaps they were faced with some predicament... In any case, the porcelein buyers tampered with your father's bonded porcelain. After that, not only did he face many setbacks in life, but he even caused your mother and you to live in misery as well. Due to some unknown reason, your father later inadvertently discovered the secrets of the bonded porcelains.

        <seg>Even though Song Jixin resented his father, there was no reason for him not to spend the money left to him. In the simple and unsophisticated small town, it was difficult to spend a lot of money even if one wanted to. Over the years, Song Jixin really had developed a hobby of collecting all types of trinkets. He had a large red chest that was filled with all types of interesting obscure items like that the green gourd, but Song Jixin had a profound and inexplicable feeling that out of all of the items in the chest, of which there were around three dozens, the gourd was the most important one, followed by a rusty violet gold bell. When shaken, it could be clearly seen that the clapper of the bell was clattering against its inner wall, so it should've produced a chime, but it was completely silent. This phenomenon bot terrified and fascinated Song Jixin. The only other artifact worthy of note was an old teapot with the word "mandrill" inscribed upon it. As for all of the other items, Song Jixin didn't really care much for them.</seg>

In the beginning, Song Jixin didn't pay much attention to it, but he later discovered that whenever there was a lightning storm, a buzzing sound would ring out from within the gourd. However, after removing the cork, no matter how much he shook or swung the gourd around, nothing would come out. He also tried filling it with water and sand before pouring it out, and the exact same amount of water and sand would be come out. Thus, he could only set it aside again. One time, Gu Can's abhorrent mother was outside his gate, taunting him over and over again about being an illegitimate son who had been abandoned by his father. The insults were really getting to him, and in a fit of rage, he picked up a blade before hacking viciously at the gourd to vent his fury. However, to his astonishment, the edge of the blade had already fully curled back, yet the gourd was still completely unscathed, with not even the slightest mark left on its surface.</seg>

Whenever the boy noticed that some of prized rocks were missing, he would fly into a rage like a wild kitten that had just had its tail trodden on, and he could stand outside Song Jixin's yard and yell profanities for two hours at a time. His mother never tried to dissuade him from this behavior.

        <seg>A man and a woman made their way into Clay Vase Alley. The man was quite young with a tall hat on his head and a green jade pendant hanging fron his waist. Looking even more like a wealthy young master than the young men from the affluent Lu Clan. As for the woman, it was difficult to discern her age. At first glance, she had decliate skin and a tapered chin that resembled stalactites hanging down from the edges of rooves during winter, but upon closer inspection, she had the mature charm of a middle-aged woman. Her phoenix eyes, her seductive figure, everything about her from head to toe gave off a sense of unadulterated promiscuity, and her hips twisted from side to side as she walked, giving off a sense of allure that was completely absent in the other women of the town.</seg>
