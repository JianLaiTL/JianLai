One disciple needs to be 'capable of shouldering great responsibilities', meaning that they're able to bring renown and success to their master and teaching. After their master passes away, this disciple will need to shoulder all the responsibilities and keep everything under control. They'll be the face of the sect.

"One disciple needs to be 'capable of carrying the torch', and this disciple will appear inferior to the first kind of disciple in every aspect and manner. However, this disciple will be extremely resilient, so even if the heavens collapse and the first kind of disciple dies, they'll still be able to guarantee that the teachings of their master are passed down. During periods of prosperity, this kind of disciple won't appear especially useful. During periods of turmoil, however, their existence will be of utmost importance.

"The last disciple needs to be 'interesting'. Their talent will be good, their aptitude will be good, and everything about them will be good. They'll also be an extremely intersting person. In fact, there's no need for this kind of disciple to feel any strong emotion or gratitude toward their master and sect. At the same time, their master won't shackle them with too many rules and regulations either. As the proverb goes, a successful pupil will make redundant their master. This final kind of disciple plays this exact role."</seg>

Back when our Sun Scorch Mountain was at its weakest and most vulnerable point, she courageously challenged the master of the Wind Lightning Field at the time, and she perished in a fair and square battle. However, not only was her body not sent back by the Wind Lightning Field to be buried on our Sun Scorch Mountain, it was simply left exposed to the elements, and there's even a longsword from a Wind Lightning Field swordsman plunged into her head, making her a spectacle to be laughed at by the entire Wind Lightning Field! It's been 300 years, and even though our Sun Scorch Mountain has been publicly acknowledged as a sect that produces an abundance of prodigious talent, we still haven't been able to pull out that single sword! Generations after generations, all of the sword cultivators of our Sun Scorch Mountain are forced to bear this humiliation. As long as the Wind Lightning Field still stands, our Sun Scorch Mountain will remain the laughingstock of the entire Eastern Treasured Vial Continent!

        <seg>"Thus, people born in this small town will all have their own bonded porcelain. Right now, the fame of Cao Xi and Xie Shi are unparelleled in the continent. One is a Daoist True Lord who has the potential to become a Heavenly Lord, whole one is a lone Sword Immortal who possesses remarkable power and might. Even though this small town is indeed capable of producing many powerful beings, the price of soaring to such a height is immense. 

"Once these people — 'porcelain' — advance to the Middle Five Tiers, they'll lose the right to afterlife or reincarnation unless they manage to advance to the Upper Five Tiers. If they fail, their soul and spirit will shatter and vanish. Even the Dao Ancestor and Buddha will be unable to save them. Meanwhile, the porcelain buyers will also obtain the bonded porcelain that allow them to control the lives of these people. So what if they become as powerful as Cao Xi or Xie Shi? This is a fate that they can't escape.</seg>

        <seg>He didn't envy Liu Xianyang for his remarkable aptitude, strength, and charisma. Instead, he envied Liu Xianyang's fearlessness. No matter where he went, Liu Xianyang was never fazed by anything, nor did he ever feel like living alone was a bad thing. Wherever he went, he was always able to quickly make friends with whoever he met, getting on such friendly terms with them that they referred to one another as brothers and would drink and play drinking games together. Due to his grandfather's ill health, Liu Xianyang was forced to become self-dependent from a very young age, making him a leader of sorts among the children in the area. He was skilled at everything, whether it be catching snakes, fishing, procuring eggs from bird's nests, making bows, fishing rods, slingshots, bird cages... It seemed like there was nothing that he couldn't do. In particular, he was the undisputed king of the town when it came to catching catfish and fishing for eels in the channels of water running through plots of farmland. Back when Liu Xianyang dropped out of the private school, the teacher there, Mr. Xu, had paid a visit to Liu Xianyang's grandfather on his sickbed, offering to Liu Xianyang an education free of charge. However, Liu Xianyang refused to go back no matter what, telling the teacher that all he wanted to do was earn money, and that he had no interest in an education. Mr. Xu then offered Liu Xianyang a paid job as a scholarly attendant, but Liu Xianyang turned down that offer as well. As it turned out, Liu Xianyang was doing quite well for himself. Even though Old Man Yao had passed away and the dragon kilns had been shut down, it didn't take long before he caught the eye of the blacksmith from Dragon Rider Alley, and he was currently busy building his own forge in the southern part of the town.</seg>

In reality, he deeply admired the supremely talented Song Jixin from the bottom of his heart. However, Zhao Yao also felt slightly dejected. Even though Song Jixin was always carefree and laughing merrily with him, with their relationship seemingly as tight-knit as could be, his intuition told him that Song Jixin had never treated him as a genuine and intimate friend.</seg>

Whenever he saw a girl, he could never control his own gaze. However, this didn't mean that he actually liked them. Instead, he simply liked to show off before them. For example, while bathing in the creek near the covered bridge during summer, Liu Xianyang would immediately try to show off his skills when a girl at the same age passed by. He would hurriedly climb onto the large green stone on the bank first, then he would cough loudly in what Chen Ping'an referred to as an act of "making an announcement to the world". Finally, he would dive headfirst into the water. With Chen Ping'an's sharp eyesight, he could clearly see the expressions of the girls in the distance. Thus, he had always wanted to tell Liu Xianyang the truth. When they saw his actions, the good-looking girls would either roll their eyes or curse under their breaths. Meanwhile, even more of them would completely ignore him, not even giving him a single glance. The only expression that they never showed was one of admiration, and one where they viewed him as an impressive man.</seg>

All of the residents of the town, of which there were over 6,000, were going to be made into scapegoats to bear the wrath of the heavens. There was a chance that they would be eternally relegated to the Path of the Hungry Ghost in the six paths of reincarnation, where they would be tormented for all of eternity without respite.</seg>

        <seg>With this in mind, he carefully contemplated his words as he put down his tea cup with cracked ice patterns. "Miss Chen, there's nothing much I can do about this," he began. "According to an elder in the office, there were originally two branches of the Chen Clan in this small town, with the two of them having different ancestors. One branch moved out of the small town a long time ago, and they didn't leave any descendants behind. However, I vaguely remember others mentioning that they especially assigned some graveyard attendents when they left. However, that was far too long ago, so it's already impossible to verify which clan was responsible for taking care of the Chen Clan's graveyard.

"As for the other branch, they also used to be one of the most powerful clans in the small town. In fact, they were among the top few clans. However, the world is impermanent, and after a few internal and external struggles, they gradually started to decline. This has especially been the case for the past few hundred years. Just like you remarked, Miss Chen, they're indeed becoming increasingly incapable by the generation. And today, there's already no more independent family from this branch.

"Oh, hang on... I just recalled that there is genuinely one lone person who's still independent. He's very likely the only member of this branch who hasn't become a servant of the Four Surnames and Ten Clans. That child's father was an extremely skilled potter, and he was even commended by two previous kiln supervision officials. This is why I still remember him. However, he died very early, and I have no idea how his child is doing now. 

"In any case, based on what I've seen and heard, the people in this small town treat the descendens of the Chen Clan fairly well overall. This is especially true when it comes to the Song Clan and the Zhao Clan, and even the head stewards in their residences are from the Chen Clan. They're masters and servants in name, but they're almost like family in reality."</seg>

        <seg>He sat down onto the doorstep and began to visualizing pottery molding with his hands suspended in mid-air, quiclky entering a completely immersive state. His commendable work ethic was one reason why he always kept up with this type of visualisation practice, while another very important factor was that the activity helped him stave off hunger. Hence, he had developed the habit of performing this type of practice whenever there was something on his mind. The crat of pottery firing was one that depended greatly on the will of the heavens. Prior to uncovering a piece of chinaware, no one knew whether its form, coloration, and glaze would be up to standard, and one could only take what they were given by the gods. However, prior to firing a piece of pottery, the molding process was undoubtedly extremely important. Unfortunately, Chen Ping'an had always been deemed by Old Man Yao to be lacking in aptitude and was mostly assigned manual labor tasks like pugging. Thus, he could only watch from the side and practice molding on his own to try and develop a feel for the process. </seg>

When he had some free time, Chen Ping'an would head over to that building to visit Liu Xianyang. After taking a trip to the doors of death, Liu Xianyang had become much less energetic and talkative than before. He also looked especially sickly and fragile. Perhaps this was because he still felt a lingering sense of apprehension in his heart after barely escaping death, or perhaps his vitality and spirit had been damaged by the Mountain-moving Ape's vicious punch.

He always stared at the roof in a daze as he lay in bed, and apart from saying a few words to Chen Ping'an from time to time, he would almost never talk to anyone else. Chen Ping'an was also helpless against this situation. Fortunately, the wound on Liu Xianyang's chest was healing quite quickly even though it was extremely severe.

        <seg>It was said that there was once a curious individual in the town who wanted to examine just how long the chain was. The old people in the town warned them that those who tried to pull the chain out of the well would have one year shaved off their lifespan with each foot of chain that was pulled, but the man paid no heed to the ominous warning. After tugging vigorously on the chain for 15 minutes, a huge pile of it had been pulled out, but there was still no end in sight. At that point, the man was already completely exhausted, and he left the pile of chain next to the well winch, proclaiming that he was going to be back the next day, and that he was determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. However, on the very same day after he returned home, he died on his bed, bleeding out of all of his orifices, and he refused to close his eyes in death. No matter what his family members tried, they were unable to get his corpse to close its eyes. In the end, an old man whose family had lived near the well for generations instructed that family to carry the corpse over to the well so that it could "watch" the old man return the chain back into the well. Finally, after the entire chain had sunk down into the depths, the body finally closed its eyes.</seg>

The child was an orphan, and he was very stubborn, refusing to cry no matter how much he was bullied, something that only served to further infuriate Liu Xianyang. One year, Liu Xianyang could tell that the little orphan most likely wasn't going to be able to make it through the winter, and he was finally stung by his conscience. Having already become a disciple of Old Man Yao's at the time, he took the young boy to the dragon kiln that was situated beside Treasure Creek. They headed west out of the town, traveling over dozens of kilometers of rugged mountain terrain under heavy snowfall. To this day, Liu Xianyang still couldn't understand how the emaciated young boy with a pair of legs as thin as baby bamboo shoots had managed to walk all the way to the dragon kiln. Even though Old Man Yao ultimately took in Chen Ping'an, the disparity in his treatment of the two boys was night and day. Even as his best disciple, Liu Xianyang wasn't spared from his beatings and insults, but even a blind man could sense the good intentions behind Old Man Yao's words and actions. For example, there was one time when he went a little too far, inflicting a bleeding gash onto Liu Xianyang's forehead. As a tough young boy, Liu Xianyang didn't think much of this, but Old Man Yao was feeling very remorseful over his actions. However, he had always kept up a stern and authoritative facade in front of his disciples, so he couldn't bring himself to apologize or enquire about his condition. In the end, he paced back and forht in his own room for almost an entire night, and he was still concerned about Liu Xianyang. Finally, he had no choice but to call over Chen Ping'an to deliver a bottle of ointment to Liu Xianyang.</seg>

I was absolutely astounded by her, so I made a few small jokes. Who knew that she would be so powerful and domineering when she wielded a blacksmith hammer in the forge, yet so timid and shy during other times. How was I meant to know that she couldn't take a joke? I made her cry at that time, and unfortunately for me, this was all caught by her father. The way that he looked at me instantly became strange. There's no way I can become his disciple now. In any case, I never planned to become anyone's slave or disciple. Dealing with Old Man Yao's strange temper was already more than enough for me.

        <seg>Liu Xianyang was Old Man Yao's best disciple. As for Chen Ping'an, Old Man Yao had never truly accepted him as a disciple due to his mediocre aptitude for the craft.

Chen Ping'an and Liu Xianyang weren't neighbors. In fact, their ancestral homes were quite far away from one another's. The reason why Liu Xianyang had recommended Chen Ping'an to Old Man Yao stemmed from their past history. Liu Xianyang was once a renowned delinquent in the town. Prior to the passing of his grandfather, there was at least an adult in the household to keep him in check, but after his grandfather passed away due to illness, Liu Xianyang quickly became an absolute nightmare for his neighbors. At the time, he was only 12 or 13 years old, but he was already no less physically developed than a young man, and one time, he somehow made enemies out of a group of boys from the Lu Family. As a result, he was ganged up on in Clay Vase Alley and handed a vicious beating. His assailants were all young boys who didn't think about the consequences of their actions, and Liu Xianyang was quickly beaten to hte point where he was throwing up blood. All of the dozen or so clans that resided in Clay Vase Alley were bottom-class potters who made a living by working at small dragon kilns, and they didn't dare to intervene.</seg>

        <seg>Lu Zhengchun watched as Liu Xianyang drew closer and closer to the covered bridge, and a sense of fierce resentment suddenly welled up in his heart. Liu Xianyang was nothing more than a piece of low-class scum that had once almost been beaten to death like a stray dog by him and his lackeys. If it weren't for that meddlig little bastard who had run out onto the street and called for help, he and his lackeys were already preparing to enact the punishment that they had agreed upon in advance, taking off their pants to give the arrogant young man a warm shower. Even now, Lu Zhengchun still couldn't understand why these high and mighty individuals had taken such a liking to Liu Xianyang. As for certain things that they mentioned like prized armor, sword scripture, Sun Scorch Mountain, the Great Dao to immortality, and fighting over resources and opportunities, Liu Xianyang could understand everything, but at the the same time, he had no idea what they were talking about.</seg>

She had only managed to catch a single crab. Moreover, the only reason that she had been able to catch that crab was because that crab had viciously pinched her finger with its claw. 

When Gu Can had Chen Ping'an about this at that time, he had been laughing so hard that he couldn't help but clutch his stomach and kick his legs. He had said that she was truly stupid, and that she had even raised her hand and purposefully waved it around to show off to him. It was as if catching the crab had been a supremely impressive feat.

According to the superstitions in the town, the fifth day of the fifth month was considered to be an ominous day during which the five poisons, namely centipedes, snakes, scorpions, geckos, and toads, all came out to spread disease and misfortune. That, in addition to the fact that his parents had passed away while he was still at a very young age, inevitably made it so that there was a negative stigma surrounding him. In particular, the old people who liked to gather under the old locust tree would always intentionally distance themselves from Chen Ping'an and encourage their grandchildren and great grandchildren to do the same.

At the same time, she pointed at Chen Ping'an and said something to the little girl. The ears of the little girl immediately pricked up to listen to what this older sister was saying. She then opened her eyes as big as she could as she looked over, and it seemed like she was able to recognize Chen Ping'an's figure. She turned around and started to explain his background to the Daoist nun, who was most likely the owner of the white deer.</seg>

The punish wasn't very severe, but it wasn't just going to be a light punishment, either. If an outsider were to kill any of the mortal residents of the town, they would be evicted without exception, but there were loopholes to be exploited when it came to battles between outsiders, and for three of the groups of outsiders who had entered the town, including Gao Zhen's, they had all brought "servants" with them precisely because they knew that there was a chance that this rule could be broken. In the case that the rule was broken, they would be able to use their servants as scapegoats and place the blamd squarely on them. It had cost half of the wealth saved up in the imperial vault of the Great Sui Nation's emperor just to earn entry for a single person into the town. The imperial vault contained what was essentially the emperor's private stash, so half of the wealth in the entire vault was naturally an exorbitant amount. If it weren't for the possibility that battles could break out between the factions of outsiders entering the town, there was no way that Wu Yue would've been sent in alongside Gao Zhen.</seg>

Under this umbrella of beauty, there existed a type that was charming, where the woman would appear both dignified and naturally alluring. This type of beauty was particularly soul-stirring.</seg>

The only problem was that the answers that he provided were often not satisfactory to Li Baoping. Sometimes, Mr. Qi would spend a long time mulling over a question that she had raised, and he would excitedly provide an answer to her the next day, only to find that she had already forgotten all about what she had asked the previous day.

        <seg>The woman faltered slightly upon hearing this, then smoothed down her hair with her hands momentarily before beginning her story. “The name of that poor boy is Chen Ping’an. Both his parents grew up in the town, and I was very close with his mother. She wasn’t particularly beautiful, but she had a fantastic personality. I don’t think I can recall an instance where she ever became angry at anyone. Her husband was far from a handsome man, and to be honest, I don’t think he was good enough for her, but he was a decent potter. If he hadn’t died so young, perhaps he would’ve been able to become the head potter at a large dragon kiln in 20 years. As for how he died, some say that on a certain rainy day, he was worried that the flame in the kilns would be snuffed out, and in his haste to get to the kilns, he slipped and fell into the creek. Others say that while out in the forest securing firewood one day, his greed got the better of him, and he trespassed onto a mountain that was sealed off by the imperial court and fell pretty to some wild beasts. In any case, his body was never found. That man had a really quite and withdrawn personality, but he was really good to his son. Whenever he returned to the town, he would always bring some small gifts like little pellet drums, candy Bodhisattva figures, or old porcelain fragments. Before he passed away, the family of three had a pretty stable life. After Chen Ping’an’s father passed away, the grief was too much for his mother to bear, and she fell ill almost overnight. Over the course of less than a year, she was so tormented by her illness that she had been reduced to nothing more than a sack of skin and bones. At the time, her neighbors and I were terrified to see her, and she was just a shell of the bubbly and outgoing woman that everyone knew and loved. During that time, Chen Ping’an looked after her. He was just a wee little child back then, but he did everything, including buying and brewing medicine, and cooking for his mother and himself. He was so short back then that he had to stand on a stool while cooking just to reach countertop, and in order to save money on medicinal ingredients, he would go all over the mountain searching for the more common medicinal ingredients. If he had any leftover, he would sell it all to the medicine shop. One time, he presumably ate the wrong medicinal herb by accident while exploring the mountains, and upon returning to the town, he suddenly collapsed to the ground and began frothing at the mouth while rolling around as if he had been possessed. We were terrified at the time, thinking that this would be the end of their family. At the time, my mother-in-law was still alive, and she said that it would be a blessing for all three of them to pass on like this so that no one would have to remain in this world and suffer alone. At the very least, they would be able to reunite in the afterlife. However, Chen Ping’an was somehow able to survive that ordeal on his own, but his mother was unable to live through the winter. Oh, that reminds me, Chen Ping’an was born on the fifth day of the fifth month. All of the older people in our alley say that this is the most unlucky day of the year, and those who are born on that day will not only lead miserable lives, they’ll bring misfortune upon their families as well. After his parents passed away, there was not a single copper coin left in their house. Even the small gifts that his father had brought back for him had all been exchanged for food with the other children in the town.”</seg>

In fact, she rarely ever went back aside from dring festivals, but in the face of this unforeseen disaster, she simply had no choice. She wanted to take her children to live in a tavern for a few days, living the life of a rich wife for once, but she simply couldn't afford that lifestyle. She was so poor that she could barely make ends meet, so she had no alternative but to go back to her parental home even though she knew that she was going to be insulted. The more she thought about this, the angrier she became, and prior to her departure, she pinched onto a piece of flesh on her husbands waist before twisting it viciously, only letting go after his entire face was twisted in agony. The two children were already accustomed to seeing this, and not only were they not concerned by the fact that their parents were fighting, they were giggling to themselves as if they were watching a good show.</seg>

After all, he was afraid that someone was trying to lure him into a trap and target his young master from Sun Scorch Mountain. Thus, he probably only had three to five years shaved off his lifespan.

"The second time was when he fought against me by the creek. That probably shaved 20 or so years off his lifespan. The third time he fought us, he probably lost at least 50 years from his lifespan. The next time he fights us, he'll probably lose at least 100 years from his lifespan."</seg>

"Mountain-moving Apes like to move around a lot, so if they don't cultivate, they naturally won't enjoy an excessively long lifespan.

If someone doesn't eat for several days, will they still have any energy left? Why do mortal empires order local officials to prohibit and shut down illegal temples? It's because they're afraid of people offering incense to the wrong deities, allowing those who don't deserve godhood to reach godhood.

"Taking a step back, even if these illegitimite gods are good-natured ones who are willing to protect local residents and never break any rules, mortal emperors don't see things the same way as us. They view themselves as "True Dragons", and they view these illegitimite temples and gods as forces that are bringing chaos to a corner of their territory.

Chen Ping'an couldn't understand Song Jixin's intention. Logically speaking, Song Jixin's personality was such that he wouldn't have asked Chen Ping'an to clean his house for him. After all, with Song Jixin's temper, he most likely wouldn't allow others into his house even if it collapsed.</seg>

This was so that Chen Ping'an didn't need to make so many back-and-forth trips.

Chen Ping'an had gone to collect snake gall pebbles at night again, yet he had come up completely empty-handed, not even finding anything in the deep pit under the Azure Cow Ridge. In the words of Ning Yao, this was because snake gall pebbles were quite similar to people. They also needed to have vitality and spirit. Once they lost these things, they would become nothing more than elegant ornaments for the nobility — perhaps they could be carved into inkstones. If they possessed vitality and spirit, however, it would be akin to a person draping on an imperial cape. The gulf between the two was like the gulf between heaven and earth.</seg>

The Chen Clan branch that she comes from has got no relationship with the Chen Clan branch that Chen Ping'an comes from. So, you don't need to worry at all. Chen Ping'an is simply just Chen Ping'an.

That's also why Old Man Yao never took a liking to him. He was a man with a keen eye, and he knew that Chen Ping'an simply wasn't cut out of this. That's what it means for him to be a piece of rotten wood that can't be carved.

        <seg>At the moment, Tao Zi was alone in a completely unfamiliar place without Bai Yuan by her side, but she wasn't fearful or concerned about her situation, merely a little bored. At the same time, she was also feeling rather disappointed as it seemed that Bai Yuan wouldn't be able to carry a mountain out of this place. This made Tao Zi feel very dejected. There was a older girl on the Sun Scorch Mountain that she referred to as Big Sister Su, and back when she first progressed to the Middle Five Tiers, she had been given a mountain as a reward to serve as her private estate. That mountain had been carried on Bai Yuan's back all the way to the Sun Scorch Mountain from a very faraway place, and it was currently situated in the northeastern part of the Sun Scorch Mountain. It wasn't a very large mountain, but Tao Zi had always been very envious of that older girl. </seg>

        <seg>There weren't any important figures in the town, nor were there any exciting events. Hence, the kiln supervision official sent by the imperial court naturally became the most prominent figure in the town, much like the all-powerful decision makers seen in stageplays. Out of the dozens of kiln supervision officials that had been assigned to the town throughout history, Master Song was the most popular with the people. He wasn't like the high and mighty officials that came before him. He didn't hide away in his official manor to work on personal cultivation, nor did he turn away all visitors and focus solely on reading and self-education. Instead, he always attended to matters related to the creation of imperial ware in person, and he was even more like a commoner than the potters working at the kilns. During the dozen or so years in which he was at the town, his original scholarly appearance had been replaced by a dark tan, and his regular attire was no different from what was worn by the men working in the fields. He never put on a high and mighty front when dealing with others, but unfortunately, the imperial ware fired using the dragon kilns in the town were never quite up to standard, regardless of whether it was in terms of shape and form, or their coloration and glaze. In fact, the imperial ware that was produced had regressed compared with before, much to the puzzlement of the old kiln masters. </seg>

        <seg>Ma Kuxuan unconsciously frowned as he tried to recall that bleak memory, and he continued, "Only my grandma remained silent, and she didn't look too happy either. Not only that, but she even scolded my father angrily, saying, 'Do you think she'll marry you just because her husband died? Why don't you take a piss and use it as a mirror to look at yourself?! The Chen Clan from Clay Vase Alley has only had a single child for many generations, so aren't you afraid of pushing all three of them to death? When this branch of the Chen Clan vanishes because of you, aren't you afraid that their Ancestal Yin God will look for you to seek revenge? Taking 10,000 steps back, are you truly not aware of that woman's personality? Are you not aware that she'll never remarry?' 

"My father wore a sheepish grin at that time, and he probably thought that he had committed to it already and was soon about to obtain his reward. So, he didn't pretend to be remorseful or sorry. In the end, my grandma pointed at my mother and viciously scolded her. However, my mother doesn't have a good temper either, so the two of them almost got into a fight in the main hall.

"My father is the type of person who's fond of the new and tired of the old, so everyone in the neighborhood disliked him at the time. He naturally helped my mother instead of my grandma, and in the end, my grandma sat down on the floor and beat her chest in grief. She lamented to that plaque as she cried, and she said that the Ma Clan had accepted a huge trouble maker in my mother into the clan. She cursed them and said that they would in discontent and regret."</seg>

To this day, those debates still haven't been settled. Spirit, method, meaning, form; those are the four fundamental elements of calligrapy. For many years, this man reigned supreme in all aspects of calligraphy, completely dominating all of the other calligraphy masters of his time. As for the idiom 'comply with the natural order', there's an interesting story behind that as well. If you look closely, you'll find that even though the technique, structure, and expression of the four characters are all very similar, in reality, each character was inscribed by a different ist master. At the time, there were two of them who were exchanging letters back and forth, arguing about which character would be assigned to them.

I'm going to tell you three things that you must make sure to remember. The first thing is that once Ning Yao is in better condition, take her to the creek south of the town and look for a father and daughter with the Ruan surname. Make sure to take Ning Yao with you. Otherwise, if you go on your own, you can visit them 100 times, and they still won't agree to meet you. After you get there, no matter what you have to do, whether that be beg and grovel, or just be shameless and refuse to leave, you have to convince them to accept you as an apprentice or a manual laborer. Regardless of whether you'll be assigned to digging wells or forging swords, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that you get them to take you under their wing. After that, Ning Yao will have repaid her debt to you as well, so don't feel like your taking advantage of her. The second thing is that after the fifth day of hte fifth month, you must make frequent visits to hte creek under the covered bridge. It doesn't matter what you do there, whether it be collecting rocks or cathching fish, the key is to visit the creek often. It's even more important that you visit the creek when you're in a bad mood or you sense something a little different from usual. As for what rewards you'll reap from those visits, given your terrible luck, I wouldn't be too optimistic, but you can only hope that yoyr diligence ca make up for your other shortcomings. If you still don't reap any rewards even after visiting the creek as much as possible, then you'll just have to accept your fate."</seg>

It appeared that Ning Yao didn't want to startle Chen Ping'an, so she didn't kick up a fuss and silently accepted the presence of the flying sword. The Daoist priest fell into deep thought for a moment, habitually tapping the lotus flower hat on his head as he did so. After taking some time to arrange his words, he said, "Prior to coming here, I heard from my senior disciple brother that we have to be reasonable in the way that we do things, and that it's important to cater to the feelings of others. Hence, I can't be too harsh and dogmatic with my words here. While it's true that everyone has their own fate, the fundamental doctrine of the sect that I belong to is different from the doctrines of more orthodox sects. Every meeting has some element of karma attached to it, and I would say that there has been some good karma established between the two of us. Hence, I'm inclined to bestow a gift upon you before I leave. I can't give you that bamboo tube and the 108 slips as the causality would be too chaotic, and they would be more trouble than they're woth in your hands. As ofr my private seal, that's a bit too hefty a gift to give. If the formation is removed, the entire town would be completely exposed, and I would be doing you a massive disserice rathre than helping you. Will I have to resrot to giving you money as a parting gift? That would be way too vulgar and tacky, I simply wouldn't be able to live with myself..."</seg>

Was it 500 years? Or 800 years? Or was it 1000 years? Afterward, this branch split into several sub-branches, and the overall population also started to gradually decline. Their fortune was perhaps all taken away by the other branch of the Chen Clan. Thus, the bloodlines started to disappear one by one, resulting in many graves being forgotten and abandoned. Not only that, but many of the mountains where the graves were located were sealed off and turned into restricted areas by the kiln supervision officials sent over by the imperial court.</seg>

Perhaps he had even experimented with elementary breathing techniques before, and maybe it was because of this that he possessed such an exceptional physique, with his body light and his bones sturdy. This then allowed him to play the cat and mouse game with Bai Yuan on the rooftops.

        <seg>During these past two days, aside from toiling away at Master Ruan's forge, Chen Ping'an would always set aside three hours to practice standing meditation, two hours during the day, from 11 AM to 1 PM, and four at night, from 9 PM to 1 AM. After following this routine for a while, Chen Ping'an began experimenting with incorporating his walking meditation into his daily duties, but he discovered that doing so resulted in a lack of consistency in his breathing and footsteps, so he immediately gave up on that experiment. Only during the breaks in his work, when no one was paying any attention to him, did he exercise his Sword Furnace to nurture his own body. For him, it was only a matter of replacing his previous pottery molding visualization practice with the standing meditation practice as stipulated in the Mountain Shaking Guide.</seg>

Not only was the Lu Manor massive, there were two stone lions placed on either side of the entrance, both of which were as tall as a grown man, presenting a rather intimidating sight to behold. According to Song Jixin, these things were capable of warding off malicious and evil entities. Chen Ping'an had no idea what these malicious and evil entities were supposed to be. He was only very intrigued by the round stond ball that each of the stone lions held in their mouths, wondering how those balls had been sculpted. He forcibly suppressed the urge to touch those stone balls, then made his way up the steps before using the bronze lion head knockers on the doors. A young man quickly made his way out of the manor, and upon hearing that Chen Ping'an was here to deliver a letter, the man pinched a corner of the letter between two of his fingers and took it from Chen Ping'an in an expressionless manner. He then quickly strode back into the manor before closing the doors, which bore a colorful visage of the god of wealth.</seg>

Regardless of the status of the gatekeeper, regardless of the condition of the town gate, even the ruler of a nation or the founder of a sect had to follow this rule upon coming here.

Outside of the maximum allotted quota of two treasure, regardless of whether one managed to collect 10 treasures, or even 100, every single one of them had to be returned. The tokens in the pouches consisted of three special types of copper coins, one of which was used by the common folk to celebrate beam raising ceremonies, another was hung upwith the peach talismans in the imperial palace each year to welcome the arrival of spring, and the final type of coin was offered up to be placed on the palms of city god statues. These three types of coins were all referred to as copper coins, but in reality, they had been minted using gold essence, which was an extremely precious material. For teh majority of the town's residents, even official silver was a very rare sight, let alone hefty bags of gold, so it was no wonder that these people were willing to sell their clans' prized treasures, some of which had already been passed down for gernerations.</seg>

"To put it simply, it means that the commoners need to be grateful to parmount Sage Confucius for his benevolence and good deeds. It was his great efforts and exhaustive work that created the scaffold for the rules and regulations today. At the same time, it's also these rules and regulations that allow the future generations to walk on the correct path and avoid calamity and disaster, thereby allowing them to reincarnate as humans again in their next life."</seg>

You'll be recognized as an official guardian of the mountains or waters. Failing this, however, you need to strive to at least enter the local county chronicles.

He was able to discover many patterns, such as how this book was approximately appended to and edited once every 60 years. Thus, Song Jixin privately referred to this book as the "Sixty-Year Chronicle". Something else he noticed was that those who were brought out of the small town by distant relatives at a young age would almost never return. It was as if they didn't like returning to their hometown — they were like flowers that bloomed inside the town, yet whose fragrance could only be enjoyed outside. Indeed, it was in this manner that many clans and families took root and grew in the outside world. In fact, some of them even grew into towering trees with deep and strudy roots.

        <seg>As one of the narrowest alleys in the entire town, the Daoist priest's cart couldn't just be left outside Chen Ping'an's yard as it would present a major hindrance to everyone trying to walk through the alley. Thankfully, even though Chen Ping'an appeared to be quite thin and lacking in physical strength, he was much stronger than he looked, and it didn't take him much effort at all to help the Daoist priest move the rather heavy cart into his yard. Throughout this entire process, Chen Ping'an didn't say anything, and that left the young Daoist priest feeling rather awkward after he closed the gate of the yard behind him. It was like he had visited someone with the intention of borrowing money from them, only for the host to welcome him with open arms and exceptional hospitality, leaving him too ashamed to ask for money.</seg>

Gu Can was the only weirdo in the small town who liked to collect snake gall pebbles, and no matter how many pebbles he found at a time, he would only take a single one home. He would only keep his favorite one. Thus, after collecting them for a long time, he was only able to gather 50 to 60 snake gall pebbles.

Song Jixin often said some things that were very difficult to understand. He most likely took those esoteric sayings from the books that he read, and Chen Ping'an was often left scratching his head in befuddlement. For example, a few days ago, Song Jixin had been saying something something along the lines of "beware of the spring chill, for it has been the death of many a young man", and Chen Ping'an had no idea what that meant. However, he had first-hand experience of the strange phenomenon where the initial period of spring felt colder than the winter each year. Song Jixin referred to this phenomenon as the unexpected spring chill, which caught many people off guard before claiming their lives, much like a sudden and unforeseen retaliation from an opponent on the battlefield.</seg>

However, she was very disgruntled by Li Baoping's gloating expression, and he really wanted to slap that smug look off her face.

Li Huai had once been beaten by Li Baoping to the point that he laid on the ground and pretended to be dead. However, Li Baoping was still unwilling to let him off the hook, and he stripped off Li Huai's pants, then tossed it high up onto a tree branch. Li Huai was bawling his eyes out as he rushed back home with no pants, and his mother was not one to let bygones be bygones. Thus, she dragged Li Huai along behind her as she stormed onto Fortune Street. However, as soon as she spotted the fearsome stone lions and tall walls of the Li Clan's manor on Fortune Street, she immediately directed her rage at Li Huai instead, giving him a vicious beating. In the end, she didn't even dare to knock on the gate of the Li Clan's manor, and she scurried back to their dilapidated house on the westernmost side of the town while dragging Li Huai along by the ear. However, in order to console her son, Li Huai's mother killed a chicken and braised it for him to eat that night. Li Huai stood on his stool with his backside still bare, swaying from side to side as he munched happily on the chicken, and the embarrassment that he had suffered at the hands of Li Baoping had become nothing more than a disstant memory.</seg>

If the gods take a liking to someone, even a stray dog on the side of the road or a weed can eventually embark on the path of cultivation and ultimately ascend to the heavens. On this occasion, the town had no choice but to break past conventions and allow so many outsiders in at once. No matter how good a plot of farmland is, after being plowed and harvested without pause for thousands of years and going through multiple ordeals where excessive harvests were made without consideration for the consequences, the land will inevitably degrade and become infertile. This place has finally reached its final harvest. Whenever someone is about to die and experiences a brief revival right before the end, their energy, essence, and spirit will all be elevated to an unprecedented peak. Gu Can is benefitting from this phenomenon right as we speak, and this is far more massive an opportunity than you can imagine.

Of course, I was able to see through her guise in the end, so she didn't do as a good a job as she thought she did, but it's already quite remarkable that someone her age is so bold and cunning. However, it's exactly because of this that if she were to be left to develop unchecked, she could eventually become an extremely potent threat to you, which was why I was determined to kill her. For a girl her age, it would've been no surprise for me at all to see her rush recklessly into battle without considering hte consequences, but it's extremely abnormal that even in the face of the threat posed by me, she was able to remain so calm and calculating, killing that assassin in such a composed fashion before putting on quite a convincing act to try and fool me.

Even though his wound had healed a little compared to before, when his bones had been visible, it was still a ghastly and bloody sight. Before coming here, Chen Ping'an hadn't imagined that he would be getting his left hand wet. Thus, he hadn't prepared any strips of cotton cloth. Just then, he had been completely focused on collecting snake gall pebbles to earn money, and on catching some fish to brew some soup. Only now did he realize that he had made a huge mistake. He was slightly at a loss. However, a hand suddenly appeared before him, holding several strips of dry and clean cloth. As it turned out, the young girl had ripped a few strips of cloth from her sleeve at some time. Chen Ping'an smiled in grief, and he had no time to express gratitude to the young girl as he rubbed the grass paste onto his wound. He then used his teeth and right hand to tightly wrap the strips of cloth around his left hand before tying a knot. His movements were extremely practiced and smooth, yet they also appeared quick and dizzying like a butterly fluttering around a flower.</seg>

Most importantly, these coins may appear to have been minted using golden, but in reality, the material used is gold essence, which is far more precious than gold and a material that's considered to be exceedingly rare even by immortals.

The fact that she was able to stand out and be selected out of all of the many descendants of the master of the Dawn Cloud Mountain was a clear testament to her character. The Dawn Cloud Mountain encompassed a total of 18 peaks of different sizes, all of which were enveloped in clouds and mist all year round. The Cloud Root Stone produced on the mountain was an important material in alchemy for those following the alchemy branch of Daoism. It was renowned for its pristine purity, and it was unrivaled in that regard. Hence, ensuring cleanliness was an important priority for the people on the Dawn Cloud Mountain, and most of them had misophobia, including Cai Jinjian. If it weren't for how important this town was, she would've never set foot in this place, let alone stepped onto Clay Vase Alley, which was laden with mud and fecal matter from all types of different animals. What was most frustrating to her was that they were supposed to be high and mighty immortals, yet upon arriving in this town, they were like helpless fish that had been tossed onto the shore, losing everything that they had previously taken for granted in the blink of an eye. Their almighty clans that resided in blessed paradise, their mystical powers that allowed them to move mountains and rivers, their powerful treasures that were capable of taming demons and slaying gods, all of that had been instantly taken away from them.</seg>

Confucianism is slightly more relaxed, and it isn't as broadly controlling as Buddhism. They simply pass on their teachings in an earnest manner, warning their disciples to remain morally vigilant even when alone. In other words, there is a focus on being true to one's words. 

"As for Daoism, they elevate the concept of 'how to think' of even further, going as far as to view internal demons as the nemisis to cultivation. They're even stricter than Buddhism, leading to many people to wander onto stray paths. As a result, there are many so-called heretical sects. Because Daosits pursue tranquility and focus on examining one's own conscience, it's extremely easy for one's mind to become a tangled mess if one becomes stuck when trying to understand the Confucian Sages' questions..."</seg>

"You might not want to hear what I'm about to say, but you at least deserve to know the truth. The assailant was most likely a cultivator, and they definitely didn't control their power properly. Moreover, your grandma was already feeble to begin with, so the combination of these factors caused her to pass away. 

"Since the assailant was a cultivator, the prime suspect is Chen Ping'an and that young girl from outside, or the young girl whose cultivation you disturbed on the covered bridge. Perhaps she attacked your grandma as an act of revenge. The probability of the assailant being Chen Ping'an and that young girl from outside is extremely small, while the probability of it being the young girl from the covered bridge is extremely big. 

"You decided to go to the unmarked burial ground to kill Chen Ping'an, and you did this with the intention of being dutiful toward your grandma.

        <seg>To say nothing of fighting with others, this reclusive young boy had never even argued with others before. Ever since he was little, he had never liked to hang out with others at his age, for example, Chen Ping'an and Gu Can. He appeared more like a wild cat who liked to run around by himself. 

When he became bored, he liked to grab a handful of stones and throw them as he walked. Of course, he would throw them very lightly, and it would look like he was simply playing. Thus, no one took this seriously. However, when Ma Kuxuan was alone on the banks under the covered bridge, he would skip stones across the surface of the water using slighty flatter stones. He could often have them skip more than a dozen times and strike the bottom surface of the stone arch bridge on the opposite bank, causing them to shatter. This was a clear indication of the dexterity of his hands and the power of his arms.</seg>

Make sure to revise them regularly. Only by repeatedly reading a book over and over again will you be able to glean its true meaning. If you can read over 10,000 books, you'll be able to write as if you were assisted by the gods. You'll understand what that means when you get to that point.

Thus, they could only transport them during heavy downpours when the mountain became muddy and slippery. If they weren't careful, they would fall into the raging waters and face perilous danger. Fortunately, no one had slipped into the creek and drowned at that time. 

Some also said that Mr. Qi from the private school had personally gone over to help, teaching the workers how to properly transport the felled trees. Thus, it was thanks to Mr. Qi that everything that gone smoothly.</seg>

        <seg>In this residence, there was only one person and one matter that could still move, Zhi Gui and the inconspicuous four-legged snake. She had noticed the abnormal situation very early on, and the first thought that had occurred to her was to go next door to look for that expressionless young girl and give her a hearty scolding. However, after noticing the existence of that sword, the maidservant gave up on this enticing thought. 

She first walked into her young master's room and shot a sideways glance at the contents of the book that he was reading. She was immediately annoyed upon seeing the words "Cao Xi", so she helped her young master flip a few pages forward. Only after seeing a paragraph about "Xie Shi" did she smile in happiness. However, she quickly flipped the book back to its initial page in a begrudging and resentful manner. This was to prevent any heavenly secrets from being revealed, and also to prevent her own secrets from being exposed. During these past years, the intelligent young master had only been suspicious of her background out of curiosity. However, he had never found any solid proof or evidence. With her grand scheme almost about to succeed, she certainly didn't want to lose everything at the final step. 

She often followed the young master to his private school, and there were some sayings of the scholars that she felt were extremely pretentious and disgraceful. For example, "one should sacrifice their life in pursuit of righteousness". However, there were also some sayings that she found quite acceptable. For example, "in a journey of 100 steps, 90 steps is only the halfway mark".  This was truly a comprehensive and easily understandable principle.</seg>

        <seg>The Daoist priest had already prepared a story, and he immediately replied, "While I was pushing my cart past the archway earlier, I spotted this young woman from out of town, and she told me that she was going to make a rubbing of the inscription on the plaque that bore the idiom of 'unmatched aura'. She had things like a rubbing pouch and a brush on her, and she quickly scaled up the archway. The act of rubbing an inscription is... How do I put this? It's basically a method of replicating a piece of calligraphy or artwork. It's something that scholars are into, and it'll take too long for me to explain to you what the process entails. In any case, after she climbed up onto the archway, she sat down onto the horizontal beam, and I was horrified for her safety, so I stopped and warned her to be careful. Much to my chagrin, she became too absorbed by her work and failed to heed my warning, ultimately falling off the archway onto the ground. As I'm sure you're aware, unlike the ground in Clay Vase Alley, the ground beneath the archway is much harder, similar to the bluestone slabs that Fortune Street is paved by, so the fall has most likely harmed even her internal organs. As a man of benevolence and upstanding character, I couldn't just leave her there, wouldn't you agree? On the way here, I asked many people to take her in, but they were all turned away by the sight of her bloodstained clothes, saying that bringing someone like her into their homes so soon after teh turn of the new year would bring bad luck to their families. While this is an understable reaction, her condition is extremley urgent and must be treated without delay. If I had any other choice, I wouldn’t have come to you. If you’re not willing to take her in, either, then I’m powerless to save her. I am but a mere mortal, not a deity with the ability to raise one from the dead. All I can do would be to accompany her in her final moments, then find a place to bury her and erect a tombstone."</seg>

According to the story, back when Liu Xianyang's grandfather was still a cihld, he had witnessed someone running only a few steps to build up momentum before leaping over the entire creek. After that, Liu Xianyang and Chen Ping'an decided to try that themselves, picking out the narrowest part of the creek before getting a running start and leaping into the air at the same time. Even though Liu Xianyang was a few years older than Chen Ping'an, he didn't travel very far before falling into the water, only to then notice a shadow vaulting over his head, continuing onward before falling into the water far ahead of him.</seg>

However, at the same time, her family couldn't have been said to be particularly wealthy, so her clothes were comfortable and warm, but not excessively extravagant.

However, his parents and his elder sister had all left the town for better prospects, leaving only Li Huai behind to live with his uncle. Now, he was also going to be leaving the town, following Old Man Ma to Mountain Cliff Academy.

        <seg>Chen Ping'an was eating a tanghulu for the first time in close to 10 years as he made his way back to Clay Vase Alley with the locust branch on his shoulder, and a sense of guilt welled up in his heart as he passed by a house that was even dilapidated than his own. He was considering borrowing some silver from Master Ruan to have the house repaired. Even though he had been living on Clay Vase Alley his entire life, he had never seen anyone live in this house. During his plot to lure Bai Yuan into the mountains, he had intentionally led the Mountain-moving Ape to this house, causing him to smash a massive hole into the roof of the house. Chen Ping'an felt a sense of responsibility to have the hole repaired. In its original state, the house would've perhaps been able to last two or three more decades, but now that it was more exposed to the elements due to the gaping hole on its roof, it most likely wasn't even going to be able to last five years. Essentially, it was the same concept as Cai Jinjian forcibly "pointing the way" for Chen Ping'an, leaving his body open and exposed, much like this house was. Hence, Chen Ping'an was determined to have the house repaired no matter what. It didn't have to be a very grand or spectacular repair job, but it had to be sturdy and serviceable.</seg>

        <seg>Chen Ping'an mulled over this. In fact, wasn't Gu Can extremely skilled at this type of fist technique? He recalled that Gu Can's mother had also seemingly been involved in an unsavory skirmish before. This was in front of a cosmetic shop on Apricot Blossom Alley. At that time, Gu Can had only just learned how to walk. Meanwhile, because his father was from out of town, and because he was always not at home, he had already been largely forgotten about by the neighbors on Clay Vase Alley. 

The other women living on the alley had started to feel worried, worried that their husbands would involuntarily pause whenever they walked by the house of that widow. Indeed, just the female clothing drying on the bamboo poles would be enough to easily fish the soul of the men away. 

Some time afterward, Granny Ma had gathered five or six women together to visit Gu Can's house. Gu Can's mother had suffered quite a bit in that battle, but Granny Ma and the others hadn't managed to gain an advantage themselves either. Both sides had suffered heavy losses. However, the longer that went on, the less that Gu Can's mother was able to maintain this balance. This was because she was a lone soldier, after all, so it was extremely difficult for her to defend against attacks form all direction. 

In the end, even her clothes had been torn to shreds. They were already thin to begin with, so it was inevitable that swathes of her skin had ended up exposed. This caused the jealous women to become even wilder with rage, clawing and biting and doing everything they could to attack Gu Can's mother. The men in the alley could only gulp with their eyes wide open when they saw this.</seg>

        <seg>When Chen Ping'an had attempted walking meditation for the first time in his home, his movements had been extremely awkward and disjointed, so much so that he appeared even more inferior than normal people. In fact, this had resulted in some slight misunderstanding between him and Ning Yao. Chen Ping'an had a quirky habit that he had always been awared of. Ever since his time working in the dragon kilns, he had discovered that his eyes were quick but his movements were slow. More precisely, the young boy's eyesight and judgement was extraordinary. However, this resulted in his hands and other movements being unable to match his judgement and understanding. 

If others attempted to imitate Ning Yao's walking meditation, even though their movements would appear rough and shoddy, they would perhaps be able to imitate 30 to 40% of it decently well. At the very least, they would do much better than Chen Ping'an's 10 to 20% accuracy. However, this was precisely because Chen Ping'an was able to observe and remember Ning Yao's movements far too well. As a result, he had tried too hard to match each movement, and this had been to a detrimental effect. With his arms and legs being unable to keep up with his mind and intention, his movements had appeared extremely awkward and comical. However, while 90% of his movements had been completely off, there had been a subtle and valuable 10% of Ning Yao's aura that he had been able to emulate.</seg>

        <seg>Chen Ping'an felt like if he collected pebbles in the morning in the future, he could start from the blacksmith forge where Liu Xianyang was. He could then continue upstream all the way until he reached the covered bridge. Thus, for tonight, he decided to start from further upstream compared to last time. This way, he would be further from the covered bridge and the green stone cliff that people often referred to as the Azure Cow Ridge. Indeed, the latter place was where he had encountered the young girl in green last time. Moreover, because of this decision, Chen Ping'an would avoid an encounter with Song Jixin and the kiln supervision official.</seg>

In some places, the red spots were bunched together in dense clumps, while in other places, they were far more spaced apart. Chen Ping'an picked up a section of the wooden figure's arm to take a closer look, and he discoverd that extremely tiny black characters were engraved beside each red spot.

Quite a few years ago, Old Man Yao once got drunk and told me that our town is no ordinary town, that it's full of strange things and strange people, but he couldn't put his finger on exactly what's strange about this place, so I naturally had no idea, either. Earlier today, I heard from Gu Can that he saw a storyteller with a normal-looking white bowl that could pour out more water than what could fit in a large water vat. Gu Can is pretty annoying at times, but I know that he didn't lie about this. There was also a very tall woman who also came to our alley earlier today, and she flicked my forehead once, then laid her palm against my chest before telling me that I was going to die very soon. She then told me that it was a joke, but I know that she was telling the truth the first time."</seg>

After that, I began to understand what I was doing wrong. In the past, I was too hasty, and the more hasty I was, the less steady my hands were, the more mistakes I made.

If their manner of walking was off by just a little, the housekeepers would immediately command someone to break their legs and toss them outside, where they would wait for death to arrive. However, Song Jixin had accused Liu Xianyang of false information, saying that it wasn't so extreme. Even so, he agreed that the maidservants in these large families did indeed have to tip toe around like cats. They weren't allowed to make any sound when they walked.

"Just look at this one. There's a large chunk missing from his fist up there, and there are also many cracks on the side. It's clear that his fist has taken a beating from slingshots or stones thrown at him. The children in the small town are all like this. The more that their guardians prohibit them from coming here to play, the more that they enjoy sneaking here to catch crickets and dig up wild vegetables.

"This is especially the case when winter arrives and snow falls. Dozens of them will come here to have snow fights, and that's truly a scene that's as lively as can be. After playing to their heart's content, will they still have the effort to worry about anything else? The children also like to compete with each other, and they try to see who can climb to the top of these statues. There are even some children who like to take a leak after climbing on top of these statues' heads, and they'll compete to see who can pee the furthest.

"So, just think about it. After so many years, how can there still be a complete and undamaged statue? In fact, there used to be a few wooden statues here when I was still little. However, I heard that there was someone who was too lazy to enter the mountains to collect firewoord, so they eventually turned their attention to these statues.

        <seg>Apart from being grazed on the back by the stone thrown by Ma Kuxuan, Chen Ping'an hadn't actually suffered too many injuries. However, this definitely didn't mean that he felt fine and dandy at this moment. The most troublesome wound was still the one on his left palm, especially since he had slowed down its healing by submerging it in water while wading through the creek to collect snake gall pebbles and catch fish. Exchanging that punch with Ma Kuxuan just then had further exacerbated the problem. 

When Chen Ping'an removed the cotton strips, the only thing he could do was retrieve a porcelain bottle from the pouch on his waist and ingest its contents. This was naturally herbal medicine he had brewed according to the prescription that he had obtained from the Yang Family's medicine shop all those years ago. Its only effect was to stop pain.</seg>

The branch of the Chen Clan in the Jewel Small World has always been a laughingstock for the entire continent. In this town, it's considered quite normal for a clan to only have one member left, while the rest of the people of the same surname have all become servants for other clans. While it's true that our branch of the Chen Clan in Dragon Tail County shares a common ancestor with the branch of the Chen Clan in this town, that's already an extremely distant piece of history, and practically speaking, the two branches may as well be different clans altogether. However, the enemies of our Chen Clan don't see it that way. If that boy from Clay Vase Alley had managed to establish an affluent clan of his own, then there wouldn't be any problems. Perhaps those on the outside will ridicule our Chen Clan for a while, but they'll eventually forget all about it. However, that boy continues to cling to life, despite the fact that he's all on his own, and in doing so, he's drawing a great deal of interest from others. There are even people on the outside making bets on when he'll no longer be the only member of the branch of the Chen Clan in this town."</seg>

In fact, Song Jixin and his maidservant never had to perform any dirty or tiring tasks.

        <seg>Qi Jingchun was rather curious about why Chen Ping'an had refrained from going for the kill here. This was a perfect opportunity, and if he were to let it slip by, the consequences could've been catastrophic. Qi Jingchun was a devout follower of the teachings of Confuciasm, strictly abiding by the code of conduct and etiquette set out by Confucius himself, but he wasn't one to dogmatically follow rules. He wasn't one of those narrow-minded scholars who only knew how to preach directly from books. When it came to people of Fu Nanhua's personality and level of aptitude for cultivation, he couldn't be more familiar with their patterns of behavior. Even if he were to be intimidated by Chen Ping'an into temporarily giving up on seeking revenge, he was definitely going to see this as the most humiliating disgrace in his life. In fact, Qi Jingchun wouldn't have been surprised if this were to become an internal demon in his Dao Heart. If that were to happen, then it wouldn't just be Fu Nanhua hunting down Chen Ping'an. Instead, he would have to face the wrath of the ruler of the South Sea, the entire Old Dragon City itself.</seg>

The conflict between you and Cai Jinjian and Fu Nanhua was mostly caused by his meddling as well. In the end, he even planted a sinister talisman in your mind — that was a script with four words, seek death with resolve. He secretly carved this in your mind, a truly sinister and and vicious act."</seg>

Since Chen Ping'an was already in a dire state, he decided that it wouldn't make much difference if his situation worsened even more. Initially, he could have lived for half a year more.

Over the years, Song Jixin really had developed a hobby of collecting all types of trinkets. He had a large red chest that was filled with all types of interesting obscure items like that the green gourd, but Song Jixin had a profound and inexplicable feeling that out of all of the items in the chest, of which there were around three dozens, the gourd was the most important one, followed by a rusty violet gold bell. When shaken, it could be clearly seen that the clapper of the bell was clattering against its inner wall, so it should've produced a chime, but it was completely silent. This phenomenon bot terrified and fascinated Song Jixin. The only other artifact worthy of note was an old teapot with the word "mandrill" inscribed upon it.

        <seg>There was a mother and son pair living on Clay Vase Alley, and they were completely unmatched in the town when it came to their ability to win arguments and deliver vicious insults. Only Song Jixin could compete with them in this regard. Among the pair, the child was particularly egregious. He constantly had two lines of snot trailing out of his nostrils, and he liked to catch fish and pick up rocks from the creek. All of the fish that he caught was kept in a large water vat, while the rocks that he collected were piled up next to the vat. For some reason, Song Jixin really liked to pick on the kid. Every sonce in a while, he would take a few rocks from the boy's collection, and this wasn't so apparent at first, but what was happening quickly became clear over time as Song Jixin was regularly taking rocks from the pile. Whenever the boy noticed that some of prized rocks were missing, he would fly into a rage like a wild kitten that had just had its tail trodden on, and he could stand outside Song Jixin's yard and yell profanities for two hours at a time. His mother never tried to dissuade him from this behavior. Instead, she was always eagerly fanning the flames, specifically bringing up the fact that Song Jixin was an illegitimate son of the previous kiln supervision official. On quite a few occasions, Song Jixin was so enraged by thsi pair that he had almost carried a bench outside to fight them, and Zhi Gui had to hold him back each time.</seg>
