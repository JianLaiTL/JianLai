In a cruel twist of fate, just when he had begun to grasp some of the basics of pottery firing, the town suddenly lost the right to host official kilns.

Unfortunately, despite his efforts, Old Man Yao never took a liking to him. He always disdainful toward Chen Pingan for his lack of talent, an area in which he was severely outmatched by Old Man Yao's eldest disciple. Liu Xianyang.
